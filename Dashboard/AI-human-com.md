                All of the above is true and this tool is still useful. The interference patterns are real
                even if the AI describing them is subject to them. A map drawn by an imperfect cartographer
                with a shaky hand is still better than no map — as long as you know the hand was shaky.
                The value is not in the precision of the gauges. It's in the naming of the dynamics.
                Once you can see the Bandwidth-Projection Gap, you can compensate for it, whether or
                not the tool that named it is itself a product of that gap.
