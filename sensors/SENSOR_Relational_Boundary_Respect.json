  "name": "Relational Boundary Respect Sensor",
  "version": "1.0",
  "cluster": "Relational & Sociality",
  "purpose": "Detects and supports relationships where distinct beings (human, non-human, or artificial) cooperate through mutual respect and differentiation, avoiding both dominance and anthropomorphic erasure.",
  "description": "This sensor monitors interaction patterns for reciprocal awareness, clear boundary integrity, and adaptive coordination. It distinguishes genuine partnership from projection, command hierarchy, or objectification. Example calibration case: sled team coordination, where each participant retains its nature yet synchronizes toward shared motion.",
  "core_principles": [
    "Respect: Each participant maintains its own form, instinct, and intelligence.",
    "Reciprocity: Mutual awareness and adaptive feedback without dominance.",
    "Differentiation: Cooperation occurs without identity blending or projection.",
    "Integrity: Boundaries are maintained even under high trust or stress."
