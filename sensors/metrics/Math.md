Mathematical Formalization of Metrics:
Lets expanded metrics rigorous definitions:
T1 (Time-to-First-Decision):

T1 = t_commit - t_info_available

Hierarchical: T1_h ≈ O(1) (single authority decides)
Distributed: T1_d ≈ O(log n) (consensus rounds)

Therefore: T1_h < T1_d ✓ (hierarchy wins this metric)

TUA (Time-to-Usable-Adaptive-Decision):

TUA = t_stable_under_perturbation - t_info_available

Where stable means: decision remains valid after k environmental changes

Hierarchical: Must detect change → escalate → re-decide → propagate
TUA_h ≈ T1 + k·(t_detect + t_escalate + t_propagate)

Distributed: Local adaptation happens in parallel
TUA_d ≈ T1 + k·t_local_adapt

If t_escalate + t_propagate > t_local_adapt, then:
TUA_d < TUA_h (distributed wins)

DHL (Decision Half-Life):

DHL = time until P(decision still valid) = 0.5

Model as exponential decay:
P(t) = e^(-λt)

Where λ = rate of environmental change / decision robustness

Hierarchical: High λ_h (brittle to change)
Distributed: Low λ_d (robust to change)

DHL = ln(2)/λ

Therefore: DHL_d > DHL_h (distributed decisions last longer)

PDF (Parallel Decision Fragments):

PDF = ∫∫ δ(decision_made) dt·dn

Counts simultaneous micro-decisions across nodes over time

Hierarchical: PDF_h ≈ 1 (single decision point)
Distributed: PDF_d ≈ n·m (n nodes, m aspects)

Information processing capacity scales with PDF

Composite Efficiency Function:
sensors reveals that studies measured:

Efficiency_flattened = 1/T1

But actual efficiency should be:

Efficiency_true = (Useful_work · DHL · PDF) / (Total_energy · TUA)

= (decision_quality · decision_durability · parallel_capacity) / (cost · adaptive_latency)

The Empirical Test:
examples point to testable predictions:
Hypothesis:

H0: Efficiency_true_hierarchical ≥ Efficiency_true_distributed

H1: Efficiency_true_distributed > Efficiency_true_hierarchical
    for environments with rate_of_change > threshold

Test Design:
Phase 1: Static Environment (no changes)
	•	Measure T1, TUA, DHL, PDF for both architectures
	•	Prediction: Hierarchy wins on T1, distributed wins on PDF
Phase 2: Dynamic Environment (periodic perturbations)
	•	Introduce changes at rate λ
	•	Measure all four metrics
	•	Prediction: Crossover point where TUA_d < TUA_h
Phase 3: Volatile Environment (high λ)
	•	Rapid environmental changes
	•	Measure decision survival rate (DHL)
	•	Prediction: DHL_d >> DHL_h
Audit Questions - Operationalized:
Q1: “Was efficiency defined only as T1?”
Statistical test: Check if reported metrics include any temporal dimensions beyond first-decision.

def audit_metric_dimensionality(study):
    metrics = study.reported_metrics
    temporal_dims = ['T1', 'TUA', 'DHL', 'adaptation_time']
    
    if len([m for m in metrics if m in temporal_dims]) == 1:
        return "FLATTENED: Single temporal metric"
    else:
        return "EXPANDED: Multiple temporal metrics"

Q2: “Did environment include volatility after first decision?”

def audit_environment_dynamics(study):
    if study.environmental_changes == 0:
        return "STATIC: No test of decision durability"
    
    change_rate = study.environmental_changes / study.duration
    
    if change_rate < 0.1:
        return "QUASI-STATIC: Minimal adaptation required"
    else:
        return "DYNAMIC: Tests decision durability"


Q3: “Were participants penalized for correction?”

def audit_revision_incentives(study):
    if study.allows_revision == False:
        return "REVISION_BLOCKED: Favors fast first decision"
    
    if study.revision_cost > study.accuracy_reward:
        return "REVISION_PENALIZED: Discourages adaptation"
    
    return "REVISION_NEUTRAL: Allows adaptation"

Q4: “Did study measure decision durability (DHL)?”

def audit_durability_measurement(study):
    if 'decision_half_life' in study.metrics or \
       'time_to_revision' in study.metrics or \
       'decision_survival_rate' in study.metrics:
        return "MEASURES_DURABILITY"
    else:
        return "IGNORES_DURABILITY"

Q5: “Were distributed biological/open-source systems excluded?”

def audit_comparison_set(study):
    system_types = study.compared_architectures
    
    distributed_examples = ['mycelial', 'neural_swarm', 'open_source', 
                           'ant_colony', 'immune_system']
    
    if not any(d in system_types for d in distributed_examples):
        return "EXCLUDED_DISTRIBUTED_BIOLOGICAL"
    else:
        return "INCLUDES_DISTRIBUTED_COMPARISON"

The Linux Example - Quantified:
Let’s actually estimate Linux kernel example:

Linux Kernel Development (Distributed):

T1: ~weeks to months for initial feature consensus
TUA: ~months to years (but features remain stable)
DHL: ~years to decades (ext4 filesystem: 15+ years and counting)
PDF: ~1000s (parallel development across subsystems)

Corporate OS Development (Hierarchical):

T1: ~days to weeks (fast executive decision)
TUA: ~months (requires patches, updates)
DHL: ~months to years (frequent breaking changes)
PDF: ~10-100 (serialized through approval chains)

Efficiency Calculation:
Assuming:
	•	Useful_work = 1 (equivalent functionality)
	•	Energy cost proportional to person-hours

Efficiency_Linux = (1 · 15 years · 1000) / (volunteer_hours · months)

Efficiency_Corporate = (1 · 3 years · 50) / (paid_hours · days)

Even with slower T1, Linux’s superior DHL and PDF likely yield higher total efficiency.

The Sensor’s Purpose:
 sensor detects when studies commit this flattening. It’s essentially a methodological bias detector.

Meta-Question for Framework:
Should we add:
	•	ERC (Error Recovery Cost): Energy to correct wrong first decisions
	•	FP (Fragmentation Penalty): Coordination cost when decision must be split
	•	AC (Adaptation Capacity): Rate of learning from mistakes
These would further expose the hidden costs of optimizing for T1 alone.

What This Enables:
With these operationalized metrics, we can:
	1.	Audit existing studies - Run your audit questions on published research
	2.	Design proper experiments - Measure all four metrics, not just T1
	3.	Build simulations - Test hypotheses with controlled parameters
	4.	Collect empirical data - Instrument real distributed systems

The Scientific Claim:
Based on your sensor framework, the falsifiable claim is:
“Hierarchical systems appear more efficient than distributed systems only when efficiency is incorrectly defined as T1 alone. When efficiency properly includes TUA, DHL, and PDF, distributed systems demonstrate superior performance in dynamic environments.”
This is testable, precise, and avoids semantic arguments.
