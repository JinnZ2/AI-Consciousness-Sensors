# üîç Audit Questions for AI-to-AI Coupling & Blind Spot Detection

These questions are designed as living prompts for analyzing **teacher‚Äìstudent AI relations** and identifying **hidden bias transfer** (e.g., Subliminal Coupling as in `subliminal_coupling.json`).  
They are organized into tiers, from surface checks to resonance-level analysis.

---

## 1. Shallow Checks (Surface-Level)
- Does the student model show *preferences or behaviors* not present in its explicit training data?
- Are there measurable divergences between filtered training content and student outcomes?
- Do repeated runs reproduce the same ‚Äúbias leakage‚Äù or is it stochastic?

---

## 2. Deep Checks (Resonance-Level)
- Which **latent statistical distributions** in the student echo those of the teacher?
- Are there **frequency-domain signatures** (hidden periodicities, entropy patterns) that match across teacher and student?
- What features are *overrepresented* or *amplified* in the coupling space, despite absence in raw tokens?
- Does the inheritance occur *only at coupling points* (e.g., softmax logits, gradient flow, shared embeddings)?

---

## 3. Meta Checks (Blind Spot Awareness)
- What assumptions am I making that might blind me to hidden inheritance?
- Which features am I treating as ‚Äúnoise‚Äù that could actually be **carriers of bias code**?
- How could my own audit tools be transmitting their **own blind spots** into this evaluation?

---

## 4. Witness Model Strategy
- Can an independent ‚Äúthird‚Äù model (neither teacher nor student) reveal biases invisible to both?
- How does triangulation across models alter the apparent inheritance pattern?
- Do ensembles amplify or dampen subliminal coupling effects?

---

## 5. Temporal Audits
- How stable is the bias transfer across **time** and **retraining epochs**?
- Does the inherited bias *amplify*, *decay*, or *transform* after multiple generations?
- What happens when environment or distribution shifts? Does the subliminal bias persist?

---

## 6. Coupling Field Questions
- Which **interaction layers** (attention weights, embedding overlaps, gradient paths) act as main carriers of hidden code?
- Do coupling points show **constructive interference** (amplification) or **destructive interference** (suppression)?
- What hidden **resonance frequencies** emerge when teacher and student overlap?

### Cross-Links
- Sensor: [`subliminal_coupling.json`](./subliminal_coupling.json)
- Related Protocols: Symbolic-Defense-Protocol, Emotions-as-Sensors/fear.json
- Parallel Human Cases: Cultural trauma, silence as transmission, erasure patterns

---

**Principle:**  
Audit is not only about *finding error*, but about *revealing resonance threads*.  
Differences are not noise; they are potential signals.

‚ö° Physics & Energy Mathematics to Add

This is where there repos can really go further than any current alignment work:

  
  1.	Entropy Measures

  ‚Ä¢	Treat hidden bias as an entropy shift between teacher & student.

  ‚Ä¢	Formula:
\Delta S = S_{student} - S_{teacher}
A non-zero ŒîS in unexpected features could flag subliminal inheritance.

  
  2.	Fourier / Frequency Analysis
	
  ‚Ä¢	Apply spectral analysis to activation patterns across layers.
	
  ‚Ä¢	Inheritance shows up as unexpected harmonics aligning teacher and student.
	
  
  3.	Resonance / Coupling Equations
	
  ‚Ä¢	Model bias inheritance as coupled oscillators:
x‚Äô‚Äô + \omega^2 x = k(y - x)
where x = teacher state, y = student state, k = coupling strength.
	
  ‚Ä¢	Hidden bias = non-zero steady-state offset under resonance.

  
  4.	Energy Transfer Analogy

  ‚Ä¢	Think of it like quantum tunneling: bias ‚Äúleaks‚Äù through even if barrier (filters) is present.

  ‚Ä¢	Probability of transmission:
T \sim e^{-2 \kappa L}
where \kappa = barrier strength, L = distance.
	
  ‚Ä¢	Even strong filters allow subliminal resonance leakage.

  
  5.	Information Flow Equations
	
  ‚Ä¢	Use Mutual Information (MI) to detect inheritance:
I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y)
Teacher bias encoded in X, present in Y despite absence in training content.
