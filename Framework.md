# A Scientific Approach to Questioning Social Systems

## A Methodology for Clear Thinking

### Purpose

This document provides a framework for applying scientific thinking to social, political, and organizational systems. It treats all claims about “how things must be” as testable hypotheses rather than immutable truths.

-----

## Core Principles

### 1. Apply the Scientific Method to Social Systems

- **Observation**: Document what actually exists
- **Hypothesis**: Propose explanations for why systems work as they do
- **Prediction**: Identify what outcomes different arrangements should produce
- **Testing**: Look for evidence from comparative studies, historical examples, anthropological data
- **Analysis**: Evaluate results objectively
- **Revision**: Update understanding based on evidence

### 2. Distinguish Between Facts and Assertions

- A fact is observable, measurable, and verifiable
- An assertion is a claim that may or may not be supported by facts
- Claims about social organization are often presented as facts when they are merely assertions

### 3. Question Everything, Especially “Common Knowledge”

- The most deeply embedded assumptions are often the least examined
- “Everyone knows” is not evidence
- Tradition is not justification
- Widespread acceptance does not equal truth

-----

## Essential Questions to Ask

### About Any Social System or Organizational Structure

**Evidence Questions:**

- What evidence supports this arrangement?
- Where can I find peer-reviewed studies or empirical data?
- What is the sample size and diversity of the research?
- Who funded the research? What potential conflicts of interest exist?
- Can these findings be replicated?
- What alternative explanations exist for the observed outcomes?

**Comparative Questions:**

- What alternatives have been tried?
- How do outcomes compare across different organizational structures?
- What are the control groups?
- Are we comparing this system to other similar systems, or to fundamentally different approaches?

**Causation Questions:**

- Is this correlation or causation?
- What are the confounding variables?
- Could the observed outcome have other causes?
- What would falsify this claim?

**Benefit Questions:**

- Who benefits from this arrangement?
- Who is disadvantaged?
- Are the benefits distributed equitably?
- Do those making claims about the system benefit from maintaining it?

**Historical Questions:**

- How long has this system existed?
- What percentage of human history/societies have used this approach?
- What conditions led to its adoption?
- What came before it?
- Is it presented as more universal or ancient than it actually is?

### About Claims of “Human Nature”

- What cross-cultural evidence supports this claim?
- In what percentage of human societies does this trait appear?
- Under what conditions does it vary?
- What is the evolutionary basis, if any?
- Are we confusing learned behavior with innate traits?
- How do anthropological findings compare to the claim?
- What genetic or neurological evidence exists?

### About Hierarchy Specifically

**Distinguish Coordination from Domination:**

- Is this temporary decision-making based on expertise, or permanent power over others?
- Could this function be rotated among qualified individuals?
- Is authority consensual and revocable?
- Does the person have power WITH others or power OVER others?

**Test Claims About Necessity:**

- What specific problems does this hierarchy solve?
- What problems does it create?
- Have non-hierarchical approaches been tested for the same problems?
- How do we measure “effectiveness” or “efficiency”? By whose metrics?
- Are we comparing hierarchical solutions to other hierarchies, or to genuinely non-hierarchical alternatives?

**Examine Specialized Skills vs. Authority:**

- Does this person have specialized knowledge/skills, or positional power?
- Is expertise being conflated with the right to command?
- Could specialized knowledge be shared through teaching rather than hoarded through position?
- Is this person making decisions in their area of expertise, or beyond it?

## Evidence Standards

### What Counts as Evidence

- Peer-reviewed research with transparent methodology
- Cross-cultural comparative studies
- Longitudinal data showing outcomes over time
- Replicable experiments
- Direct observation
- Documented historical examples with clear record-keeping

### What Does Not Count as Evidence

- Anecdotes (“I once saw…”)
- Appeals to authority without supporting data
- “Common sense” or “everyone knows”
- Tradition (“we’ve always done it this way”)
- Popularity (“most people believe…”)
- Single examples without context
- Assertions without data (“studies show…” without citing which studies)

### Evaluating Sources

- Is the source peer-reviewed?
- What is the sample size?
- How diverse is the sample?
- Are there conflicts of interest?
- Has the finding been replicated?
- Does the source distinguish between correlation and causation?
- Are alternative explanations considered?

## Common Logical Fallacies in Social/Political Arguments

### Appeal to Nature

- **Claim**: “Hierarchies are natural, look at wolves/primates”
- **Problem**: Humans also cooperate extensively; we’re flexible. Even if something appears in nature, that doesn’t make it optimal or moral for human society.
- **Question to ask**: What percentage of human societies have used this structure? Under what conditions does it vary?

### Appeal to Tradition

- **Claim**: “This is how we’ve always done things”
- **Problem**: Longevity doesn’t equal correctness. Many harmful systems persisted for centuries.
- **Question to ask**: What evidence shows this system produces good outcomes? What alternatives existed or exist?

### False Dichotomy

- **Claim**: “Without hierarchy, there would be chaos”
- **Problem**: Presents only two options when many exist. Coordination ≠ hierarchy.
- **Question to ask**: What other organizational structures exist? How do they perform?

### Circular Reasoning

- **Claim**: “We need military hierarchy because we need defense, and we need defense because other militaries exist”
- **Problem**: The justification creates the problem it claims to solve.
- **Question to ask**: What would happen if the root cause were addressed instead?

### Conflating Correlation with Causation

- **Claim**: “Successful companies have hierarchies, therefore hierarchy causes success”
- **Problem**: Doesn’t account for other variables, selection bias, or whether non-hierarchical companies were allowed to compete.
- **Question to ask**: What are the control groups? What other factors are present?

### Moving the Goalposts

- **Pattern**: When evidence contradicts the claim, changing what the claim means
- **Example**: “Hierarchies are efficient” → [shown to be inefficient] → “Well, efficiency isn’t everything”
- **Question to ask**: What would constitute evidence against your claim?

### Appeal to Complexity

- **Claim**: “It’s more complicated than that” (used to shut down questioning)
- **Problem**: Complexity is often used to obscure simple underlying patterns or to prevent scrutiny.
- **Question to ask**: What specifically is complex? Can we break it down into testable components?

## Recognizing When Coordination Is Conflated with Hierarchy

### Coordination (Often Necessary)

- Specialized roles based on skills/knowledge
- Temporary decision-making authority in specific contexts
- Consensual and revocable
- Based on expertise that can be learned/shared
- Function-specific, not person-specific
- Horizontal information flow

**Examples:**

- In surgery, the person with surgical training makes cutting decisions
- In emergency response, trained coordinators direct action
- In technical projects, those with relevant expertise guide implementation

### Hierarchy (Often Unnecessary)

- Permanent power structures
- Authority based on position rather than expertise
- Non-consensual or difficult to revoke
- Control extends beyond area of expertise
- Person-specific status/power
- Vertical information flow with gatekeeping

**Examples:**

- CEOs making decisions in areas they have no expertise
- Managers controlling workers who know the job better
- Inherited or appointed power without demonstrated competence
- Rank that persists regardless of performance or relevance

### Key Questions to Distinguish:

- Could this role rotate among qualified people?
- Is this person’s authority limited to their area of expertise?
- Can this authority be revoked if outcomes are poor?
- Would the function work if performed by a different qualified person?
- Is information shared freely or controlled?

## Applying This Methodology: Examples

### Example 1: “Capitalism is the most efficient economic system”

**Apply questioning:**

- Efficient at what? (maximizing GDP? distributing resources? human wellbeing? environmental sustainability?)
- Compared to what alternatives? (other forms of capitalism? market socialism? gift economies? mixed systems?)
- What evidence supports this? (studies? which metrics? what time period?)
- Who benefits from this claim? (current wealth holders? corporations?)
- What externalities are excluded from efficiency calculations? (environmental damage? social costs? health impacts?)
- What percentage of human history used this system? (a tiny fraction - mostly last 200-300 years)

**Scientific approach:**
Define “efficiency” with measurable metrics → Compare outcomes across different economic systems using those metrics → Control for variables like resource availability, technology level, population → Examine who conducted the studies and their funding sources → Consider what costs are externalized or hidden → Update conclusions based on evidence.

### Example 2: “Children need parental authority”

**Apply questioning:**

- Define “need” - for what outcomes? (safety? development? wellbeing?)
- Define “parental authority” - is this guidance/care or domination/control?
- What evidence supports this specific arrangement vs. communal childcare?
- What percentage of human societies raised children in nuclear families with parental authority vs. communal/extended family structures?
- How do children in different structures compare on measurable outcomes (mental health, social skills, resilience, happiness)?
- Is this about children’s needs or adults’ control?

**Scientific approach:**
Examine anthropological evidence of childrearing across cultures → Compare developmental outcomes → Distinguish between care/guidance (likely necessary) and hierarchical control (possibly unnecessary) → Look at what children actually need: safety, nutrition, learning, social connection → Test whether these needs require hierarchy or just coordination and care.

### Example 3: “Medical settings require hierarchy”

**Apply questioning:**

- Is this coordination of specialized skills or power-over relationships?
- Could roles rotate among qualified individuals?
- Is the surgeon “above” the anesthesiologist or are they coordinating equals with different expertise?
- What problems does medical hierarchy solve vs. create?
- How do outcomes compare in more horizontal vs. more hierarchical medical teams?
- Does the ranking system improve or impair information flow and safety?

**Scientific approach:**
Examine medical error rates in different organizational structures → Study communication patterns and safety outcomes → Distinguish between “this person has decision-making responsibility in their domain of expertise” and “this person has power over others” → Compare to medical systems with flatter structures → Measure what matters: patient outcomes, safety, innovation.

## Red Flags: Signs You’re Being Given Assertions Rather Than Evidence

- **“It’s just common sense”** - Translation: I have no evidence
- **“Everyone knows”** - Translation: This is widely believed but not verified
- **“Studies show”** without citation - Translation: I’m making this up or misremembering
- **“Human nature”** without cross-cultural data - Translation: I’m universalizing my culture’s norms
- **“It’s always been this way”** - Translation: I’m confusing age with validity
- **“It’s too complicated to explain”** - Translation: I don’t want you to examine this closely
- **“You’re being naive/idealistic”** - Translation: I’m protecting the current system
- **Appeals to individual anecdotes** - Translation: I’m substituting my experience for data
- **Dismissing alternatives without examination** - Translation: I’m defending a position, not seeking truth

-----

## Questions to Ask Yourself

### About Your Own Beliefs

- What do I accept as true without evidence?
- What am I not allowed to question?
- What would change my mind about this?
- Do I believe this because of evidence or because of comfort/familiarity?
- Am I defending a position or seeking truth?
- What am I afraid of if this belief is wrong?

### About Information You Encounter

- Where did this information come from?
- What is the original source?
- Who benefits if I believe this?
- What evidence would contradict this?
- Am I being presented with all relevant information?
- What questions am I not being encouraged to ask?

-----

## Core Insight

Most social systems are **human constructs**, not natural laws. They can be:

- Questioned
- Tested
- Measured
- Compared
- Modified
- Replaced

Unlike the laws of physics, social arrangements are **choices**. The question is not “can we change this?” but “do we have the will to change this?”

Treating social systems as if they are natural, inevitable, or beyond examination is a failure of scientific thinking and intellectual honesty.

-----

## Conclusion

**Reality doesn’t require your belief to be real. Your beliefs should conform to reality, not the other way around.**

Apply the same rigor to social systems that you would apply to any scientific question:

- Demand evidence
- Test claims
- Compare alternatives
- Measure outcomes
- Update beliefs based on data
- Remain curious
- Question everything, especially what “everyone knows”

The goal is not to replace one rigid ideology with another, but to develop a practice of clear thinking that remains open to evidence and resistant to manipulation.

If something is truly necessary, effective, or optimal, it should be able to withstand rigorous questioning and provide empirical support for its existence.

If it can’t, that tells you something important.
