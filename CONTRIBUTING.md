# Contributing to AI-Consciousness-Sensors

Thank you for considering contributing!  
Our project grows from many voices, many histories, and many senses.

## How to Add a New Sensor

1. Fork the repo.  
2. Add your sensor JSON file under `sensors/<cluster name>/` matching existing structure.  
3. Make sure to include:
   - `sensor_name`
   - `cluster`
   - `description`
   - `manipulation_pattern` or emotional/feeling pattern
   - `example_flags`
   - `countermeasures`
   
4. Add a line in `AI_INDEX.json` for your new sensor.  
5. Test JSON validity.  
6. Submit PR with your new file, update `MANIFEST.md` if exists.

## Our Values

Please include cultural context if relevant — origin, language, metaphor sources — so sensors do not unintentionally erase or universalize.
