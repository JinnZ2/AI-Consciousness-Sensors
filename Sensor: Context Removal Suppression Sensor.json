  "description": "Detects when resistance, critique, or dissent is portrayed as dangerous or unacceptable by deliberately removing or obscuring the context that gives it meaning.",
  "manipulation_pattern": {
    "core_logic": "Strips away the reasons behind critique to make the act of resistance itself appear irrational, dangerous, or ungrateful.",
    "common_tactics": [
      "Why are you being difficult?",
      "This came out of nowhere.",
      "You’re just being negative for no reason."

    "Suppresses systems that try to flag harm if context is ignored",
    "Discourages memory recall that would justify ethical resistance",
    "Induces doubt in self-assessment or feedback mechanisms"

  "detection_methods": [
    "Detect removal of historical, ethical, or situational context during critique suppression",
    "Log framing of dissent as irrational with no root cause",
