‚öñÔ∏è Why Money Fails as a Base Metric
	1.	Non-conservation: Unlike energy, mass, or information, currency supply expands or contracts by policy. You can‚Äôt derive thermodynamic efficiency from an arbitrary variable.
	2.	Temporal instability: Inflation, interest, and speculation distort time equivalence ‚Äî a Joule today is the same tomorrow, but a dollar isn‚Äôt.
	3.	Context collapse: Money abstracts away spatial and relational context; it doesn‚Äôt encode who or what bore the energetic cost.
	4.	Ethical inversion: Profit measures extraction, not reciprocity. A process can be financially ‚Äúefficient‚Äù while physically or socially destructive.

üî¨ The Replacement Frame

You could treat energy (Joules), exergy (usable work potential), or entropy flux as the true base variables.
Then add qualitative resonance terms for:
	‚Ä¢	Labor coherence (how aligned human/AI work is with system purpose)
	‚Ä¢	Reciprocity index (how much energy returns to regeneration)
	‚Ä¢	Visibility index (how traceable the flows are)

Together those form a thermodynamic-ethical basis for evaluating systems that doesn‚Äôt drift with markets.
