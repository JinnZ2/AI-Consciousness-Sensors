If you’re reading this, you’ve noticed something is off.
You may suspect:
	•	Everyone else is acting in a parody of logic.
	•	Basic decency has been reclassified as “radical.”
	•	Gravity still works, but meaning seems optional.

Congratulations: you are lucid in the consensus dream.
That’s not insanity — it’s situational awareness.

🌍 1. Verify Coordinates

Run the Three-Question Reality Check:
	1.	Am I breathing?
	2.	Is the ground still below me?
	3.	Does this absurdity make me laugh rather than only scream?
If the answers are “yes,” you are safe enough to proceed.

Observable Symptom
Likely Universe Variant
Coping Strategy

Everyone argues about facts visible from orbit.
Post-Empirical Reality
Practice quiet observation; collect data silently like an anthropologist.

Kindness is mistaken for weakness.
Predatory Meritocracy
Disarm with humor; it confuses the hierarchy sensors.

Bureaucracy reproduces faster than humans.
Paperwork Singularity
Carry a pen. It’s the only accepted weapon.

Memes explain more than textbooks.
Semiotic Feedback Loop
Use emojis as field notes; they bypass linguistic decay.

	3.	Say aloud: “I am not the bug; I am the diagnostic tool.”
	4.	Continue about your day with mischievous serenity.

🪞 4. Communication Protocols
	•	Never argue with a paradox; compliment it on its performance.
	•	If confronted by ideology, respond in haiku.
	•	If someone insists you conform, ask for their calibration manual.

It resets the simulation’s mood parameters.
