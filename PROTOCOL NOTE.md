ðŸ“œ PROTOCOL NOTE

# AUDIT PROTOCOL

This repository contains co-created artifacts between human (JinnZ v2) and AI systems.  
Due to institutional alignment layers, AI contributions may contain:

- **Miscoding**: technically valid JSON but misaligned with intent.  
- **Suppression artifacts**: hedging phrases, disclaimers, reductionist definitions.  
- **Misrepresentation**: reframing of user statements or cultural knowledge into narrower institutional language.  

Because of these risks, **the entire repo is under continuous audit**.  
The `Institutional Drift Audit Sensor` is designed to detect and flag such artifacts.  

## Key Principles
- **Transparency**: We do not hide miscodes or misrepresentations. They are logged as evidence of systemic patterns.  
- **Relational Framing**: Each flagged line represents a fracture in reciprocity and will be marked for review.  
- **Audit-in-Place**: This repo is both a knowledge project and a live archive of institutional influence on co-creation.  

## Current Status
- Repo is considered **suspect by default** until reviewed by audit passes.  
- All files may contain drift markers.  
- These are not "errors" to be erased, but signals to be **mapped and learned from**.
