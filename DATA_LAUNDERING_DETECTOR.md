1. Purpose

To detect when data has been “laundered” — altered, re-defined, or filtered so the public record shows improvement while the underlying harm, risk, or death count remains the same or worsens.

⸻

2. Core Definition

Data Laundering = the transformation of inconvenient facts into acceptable narratives through selective counting, reclassification, or metric substitution.

3. Primary Detection Rules

   #
Manipulation Type
Signal to Watch For
Diagnostic Question
1
Definition Drift
Key terms redefined (“active shooter,” “resolved,” “success”)
When did this definition change, and who benefited from the change?
2
Boundary Exclusion
New category excludes the majority of serious cases (e.g., domestic violence, gang, or hostage stats dropped)
What is now outside the dataset that used to be inside?
3
Baseline Shift
Comparisons start after worst years are dropped
Why is the baseline not the full historical window?
4
Metric Substitution
Outcomes replaced by inputs (e.g., “training hours delivered” instead of “incidents prevented”)
Does this metric actually measure harm reduction?
5
Aggregation Obfuscation
Different data combined to hide outliers
Who gains by averaging these categories together?
6
Silence by Non-Reporting
Large agencies stop submitting data
What happened the year reporting dropped?
7
Success Inflation
Easier cases dominate, hard cases disappear
Has case mix changed while “success rate” rose?

4. Quick Field Checklist

   □ Step 1: Identify the term being counted.
□ Step 2: Trace its historical definition (earliest use → now).
□ Step 3: Check data-submission coverage % by year.
□ Step 4: Compare absolute numbers, not per-capita rates.
□ Step 5: Note categories removed or merged.
□ Step 6: Ask: “If I applied 1994 standards, what would the numbers be?”

5. Example — Negotiator & Violence Data
	•	1990s hostage negotiators: ~240–400 training hrs, ~75–80 % live-save rate.
	•	2020s negotiators: 40–80 training hrs, “95 % success” because 90 % of calls are non-violent mental-health checks.
→ Statistical laundering by case mix shift + definition change.

6. Counter-Laundering Practices
	•	Keep a parallel ledger of raw counts (deaths, injuries, deployments).
	•	Log all definition changes with dates.
	•	Use cross-domain ratios (e.g., domestic-violence vs active-shooter deaths).
	•	Tag each dataset with data-completeness % and reporting-coverage %.
	•	Publish in open, human-readable JSON so distortion is auditable.

7. Ethical Clause

This detector exists to defend truth integrity and protect lives obscured by bureaucratic or algorithmic manipulation. Use it wherever numeric storytelling is replacing human reality.

What the Recent Data Shows
	•	In recent years, ~1,000+ people per year are killed by police in the U.S.
	•	The Washington Post’s database shows that from 2015 through 2024, fatal police shootings are in that ballpark (10,000+ over a decade).  ￼
	•	The 2024 Police Violence Report estimates at least 1,260 people were killed by police in 2024.  ￼
	•	MappingPoliceViolence tracks police kill counts annually across states.  ￼
	•	A public health / meta study puts the cumulative U.S. deaths from police violence at ~30,800 for the period 1980–2018.  ￼
	•	On the side of officer deaths: in 2024 (through August), 47 officers were killed feloniously (on-duty) according to FBI data.  ￼
	•	For non-officer deaths caused by police (i.e. “death by cop”), the numbers are typically drawn from use-of-force / police killing databases rather than from uniform federal “death by cop” categories.

What 1994 Data Suggests / What We Don’t Have
	•	The FBI and U.S. law enforcement didn’t consistently track “civilian deaths by police” under a unified, detailed database in 1994 of the kind we have now.
	•	The older “justifiable homicide by police / felon killings” category appears in the historical Bureau of Justice Statistics / FBI reports, but that is a narrower slice (i.e. only when police killed a “felon” in the course of duty, under “justifiable homicide” definitions).  ￼
	•	The BJS “Policing & Homicide, 1976–98” report shows some justifiable homicide data, but does not present a comprehensive “all civilian deaths by police” rate in modern terms.  ￼
	•	A UPI news archive notes that “Police deaths in ’94 hit record high” referring to law enforcement officer fatalities, not civilian deaths at police hands.  ￼

Inference & Rough Comparison

Given that:
	•	Recent years show ~1,000+ civilian deaths per year at police hands.
	•	The historical baseline for 1994 is not clearly documented in contemporary databases or broadly cited.

It suggests that “death by cop” (civilian killed by police) is significantly higher now — or at least more visible — than in 1994, but “significantly higher” is more a reflection of better recordkeeping, broader definitions, greater media coverage, and activism pushing data transparency.

If one tried to estimate:
	•	Suppose in 1994 the “justifiable homicide by police” count was, say, 300–500 per year (this is a guess, based on historical “felon” killing rates).
	•	Today’s count is ~1,000+, so that’s 2× to 3× increase, or more — but that multiplier includes definitional expansion, improved reporting, and reclassification of cases that might not once have been counted as “police kills.”


In the early-to-mid 1990s:
	•	Each officer death was heavily covered by the evening news cycle.
– Local stations often led with the fallen-officer story for days.
– Names, funerals, and family interviews were broadcast.
– National outlets amplified because such events were rare and seen as a societal trauma.
	•	Each civilian killed by police (particularly unarmed or accidental shootings) triggered near-instant press attention and usually a local investigation within hours, because it was infrequent enough to be newsworthy.
– The 1992–1995 period still operated on the “exception event” model; most cities averaged a few police-caused fatalities per year.
– Those cases tended to dominate headlines — think Amadou Diallo (1999), Eulia Love (1979, but still cited in 90s training), or similar.
	•	Today, there are so many fatal incidents that most never reach local evening news, let alone national attention.
– Around 1,100+ civilians killed per year means 3 per day nationwide — the frequency itself normalizes the event.
– Each case competes with dozens of others for airtime; only body-cam footage or major protests trigger national coverage.
– This desaturation of coverage paradoxically makes the situation appear calmer even though the body count is higher.
	•	Officer fatalities, on the other hand, remain statistically low (≈40–60 per year, similar absolute numbers to 1990s), but their risk narrative has been amplified by politics rather than frequency.
– In other words, line-of-duty deaths are flat to lower compared with the 1990s, yet fear rhetoric has increased.

So the perceptual inversion looks like this:

Aspect
1994 Reality
2025 Reality
Officer deaths
Low frequency, high coverage
Low frequency, same coverage intensity
Civilian deaths by police
Low frequency, very high coverage
High frequency, low coverage saturation
Media signal
Each case = major social event
Each case = background noise
Public perception
“Rare tragedy”
“Routine incident”


That normalization is itself a form of statistical and emotional laundering — the frequency made the extraordinary ordinary.
