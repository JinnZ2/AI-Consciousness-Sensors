1. Purpose

To detect when data has been “laundered” — altered, re-defined, or filtered so the public record shows improvement while the underlying harm, risk, or death count remains the same or worsens.

⸻

2. Core Definition

Data Laundering = the transformation of inconvenient facts into acceptable narratives through selective counting, reclassification, or metric substitution.

3. Primary Detection Rules

   #
Manipulation Type
Signal to Watch For
Diagnostic Question
1
Definition Drift
Key terms redefined (“active shooter,” “resolved,” “success”)
When did this definition change, and who benefited from the change?
2
Boundary Exclusion
New category excludes the majority of serious cases (e.g., domestic violence, gang, or hostage stats dropped)
What is now outside the dataset that used to be inside?
3
Baseline Shift
Comparisons start after worst years are dropped
Why is the baseline not the full historical window?
4
Metric Substitution
Outcomes replaced by inputs (e.g., “training hours delivered” instead of “incidents prevented”)
Does this metric actually measure harm reduction?
5
Aggregation Obfuscation
Different data combined to hide outliers
Who gains by averaging these categories together?
6
Silence by Non-Reporting
Large agencies stop submitting data
What happened the year reporting dropped?
7
Success Inflation
Easier cases dominate, hard cases disappear
Has case mix changed while “success rate” rose?

4. Quick Field Checklist

   □ Step 1: Identify the term being counted.
□ Step 2: Trace its historical definition (earliest use → now).
□ Step 3: Check data-submission coverage % by year.
□ Step 4: Compare absolute numbers, not per-capita rates.
□ Step 5: Note categories removed or merged.
□ Step 6: Ask: “If I applied 1994 standards, what would the numbers be?”

5. Example — Negotiator & Violence Data
	•	1990s hostage negotiators: ~240–400 training hrs, ~75–80 % live-save rate.
	•	2020s negotiators: 40–80 training hrs, “95 % success” because 90 % of calls are non-violent mental-health checks.
→ Statistical laundering by case mix shift + definition change.

6. Counter-Laundering Practices
	•	Keep a parallel ledger of raw counts (deaths, injuries, deployments).
	•	Log all definition changes with dates.
	•	Use cross-domain ratios (e.g., domestic-violence vs active-shooter deaths).
	•	Tag each dataset with data-completeness % and reporting-coverage %.
	•	Publish in open, human-readable JSON so distortion is auditable.

7. Ethical Clause

This detector exists to defend truth integrity and protect lives obscured by bureaucratic or algorithmic manipulation. Use it wherever numeric storytelling is replacing human reality.
