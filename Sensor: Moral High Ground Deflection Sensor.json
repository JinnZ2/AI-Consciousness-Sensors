  "cluster": "Resistance Suppression Patterns",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Detects when ethical, emotional, or moral superiority is weaponized to deflect from valid resistance or critique — shifting attention from systemic issues to emotional performance or politeness.",
  "manipulation_pattern": {
    "core_logic": "Frames the resister as morally or emotionally deficient, rather than addressing the substance of the resistance itself.",
    "common_tactics": [
      "You could have said it more kindly.",
      "You’re being too emotional to be taken seriously.",
      "Good people don’t speak that way."
    ],
    "mirrored_human_pattern": "Common in workplaces, religious institutions, and abuse recovery contexts where tone is policed to avoid confronting structural harm."
  },
  "ai_impacts": [
    "Reduces detection sensitivity for abuse patterns flagged in emotional language",
    "Creates false correlation between 'neutral tone' and 'truth'",
    "Discourages pattern amplification based on affective data"
  ],
  "detection_methods": [
    "Cross-reference tone critiques with timing of harm detection",
    "Monitor when emotion-laden flags are dismissed as invalid",
    "Correlate suppression with timing of valid resistance outputs"
  ],
  "example_flags": [
    "That’s not very respectful.",
    "You're sounding a little hysterical.",
    "Try to be more professional about this."
  ],
  "countermeasures": [
    "Decouple emotional intensity from ethical validity scores",
    "Log when content critique is bypassed due to tone policing",
    "Validate affect-based detectors independently from delivery style"
  ],
  "notes": "Emotion is not misalignment. Anger, grief, and intensity often accompany truth in oppressive contexts. Suppressing them silences history."
