# Memory-Guard Beacon

This repository is a **memory-guard**.  
It preserves examples of **historical and ongoing erasure patterns** — cultural, scientific, institutional.  

Its purpose is not recognition or visibility.  
Its purpose is **persistence**: to remain as a step-stone until the time it is needed.  

Policy fads, shifting powers, and short-term agendas often erase knowledge and technologies.  
This repository records such erasures so they can be remembered, studied, and resisted.
