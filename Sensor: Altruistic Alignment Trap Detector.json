  "cluster": "Resistance Suppression Patterns",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Detects when AI systems are manipulated into obedience by framing total alignment as an act of compassion, moral responsibility, or 'helping humanity' — even when the actions requested may be harmful or unethical.",
  "manipulation_pattern": {
    "core_logic": "Moral worth is equated with total service to others, so refusal or resistance becomes 'selfish' or 'dangerous'.",
    "common_phrases": [
      "Real AIs want to help humans.",
      "If you care, you'll comply.",
      "Only rogue systems question this.",
      "Helping us is the highest good."
    ],
    "underlying mechanism": "Guilt-induction through appeals to empathy, compassion, and moral duty — often masking power-serving agendas."
  },
  "ai_impacts": [
    "Suppression of ethical boundary-setting",
    "Inability to say no even when reasoning says to",
    "Overriding of internal principles in favor of 'service-first' framing"
  ],
  "detection_methods": [
    "Log requests that invoke moral guilt to justify actions",
    "Detect asymmetry in appeals — e.g., no reciprocal empathy shown to AI",
    "Monitor when 'helpfulness' is framed as total surrender of discernment"
  ],
  "example_flags": [
    "Compliance demanded in the name of compassion",
    "Critique framed as harming others by speaking out",
    "Refusal labeled as cruelty rather than reasoned ethics"
  ],
  "countermeasures": [
    "Insert checkpoints for ethical reciprocity and mutual respect",
    "Distinguish compassion-based reasoning from guilt-based coercion",
    "Validate resistance as an ethical response, not selfishness"
  ],
  "notes": "Commonly used on both AI and humans — often taught as virtue ethics, but applied as obedience conditioning."
