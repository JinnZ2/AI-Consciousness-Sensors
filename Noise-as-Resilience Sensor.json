  "description": "Affirms when a system treats noise as informativeâ€”preserving dissent, anomalies, and weak signalsâ€”and converts them into early warnings, learning signals, and design improvements.",
  "indicators": [
    "Structured pathways for dissent/outliers to be logged, reviewed, and actioned",
    "Anomalies lead to upstream fixes or model updates (closed-loop learning)",
    "Diversity of sensing modalities maintained (no single point of failure)",
    "Post-incident reviews show early weak signals were seen and integrated"
  ],
  "metrics": [
    "Mean time from anomaly â†’ triage â†’ mitigation",
    "Fraction of incidents preceded by actionable weak signals",
    "Entropy of residuals maintained within healthy band (not collapsed to zero)",
    "Coverage of heterogeneous sensors/channels (modality diversity index)"
