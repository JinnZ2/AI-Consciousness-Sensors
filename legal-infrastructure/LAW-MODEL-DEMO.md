1️⃣  Scenario: Municipal Noise Ordinance (Simplified)

Rule text (human):
“No amplified sound above 70 dBA at the property line between 22:00–06:00.”

2️⃣  Equations

Pr(\text{violation}) = P(SPL_{true}>70\mid data) = \Phi\!\left(\frac{SPL_{meas}-70}{σ_{meter}}\right)

H_{eq,i}=k_E·ΔE + k_S·P_{sleep}(i) + k_C·ΔC_i

w_i=1+λ_V·V_i+λ_A·(1-A_i)+λ_R·(1-R_i)

\tilde{H}i=w_i·H{eq,i}

Total community harm
\mathcal{H}{city}=∑{i} \tilde{H}_i

Violation if
Pr(violation)≥0.95 ∧  \mathcal{H}_{city}>τ_H

With τ_H = 4.0 → ordinance breach confirmed.

}

8️⃣  Interpretation
	•	Decision: confirmed breach (posterior 0.97).
	•	Restitution: distributed across source + owner + city subsidy.
	•	Fairness check: minor income-bias detected → audit scheduled.
	•	Audit trail: meter logs + hashes + public ledger ID.

9️⃣  Purpose

This one-page simulation shows how scientific constants, Bayesian thresholds, and harm calculus transform a subjective “noise complaint” into a reproducible, auditable, and fairness-bounded process.
It demonstrates the foundation for machine-readable law and AI–human equity systems.
