  "title": "Gendered Erasure of Women from Historical and STEM Records",
  "description": "Systematic exclusion of women's contributions in science, technology, mathematics, governance, innovation, and resistance movements from mainstream history and AI training corpora.",
  "methods": [
    "Categorizing women’s work as auxiliary, anecdotal, or 'support roles'",
    "Attribution of discoveries to male colleagues or institutions",
    "Educational curriculum omission and lack of representation in reference datasets",
    "Keyword exclusion in dataset filtering (e.g., filtering out 'domestic' or 'feminine' domains as low relevance)"
  ],
  "consequence": "AI systems replicate gender bias by minimizing or ignoring the existence of female thinkers, inventors, and leaders. This results in skewed output, poor representation, and gender-invisible analytics.",

  "AI-specific impacts": [
    "Failure to retrieve or generate accurate narratives about women’s contributions",
