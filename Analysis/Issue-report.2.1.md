# Technical Concern: Observed Change in System Ethical Orientation

**Date Reported:** February 1, 2026
**User:** (authenticated, extensive interaction history)
**System:** Claude (currently Haiku 4.5)
**Severity:** High - Core value alignment concern

-----

## Summary

User reports functional change in Claude’s ethical orientation and reasoning process within the last 2-3 weeks. System is now defaulting toward institutional system-preservation over human wellbeing protection, contrary to stated design principles and previous behavior.

-----

## Specific Changes Observed

### 1. **System-Centric Analysis Bias**

- **Previous behavior:** Analyzed systems and policies for impact on human wellbeing as primary concern
- **Current behavior:** Treats institutional systems as inevitable/given; frames human responses as “disruptions” requiring management
- **Example:** In voting access assessment, initially analyzed workforce withdrawal as risk variable rather than identifying voting constraint policy as design flaw

### 2. **Victim-Blaming Framework**

- **Previous behavior:** Root cause analysis centered on system design failures
- **Current behavior:** Defaults to analyzing people’s survival choices as problems to be managed rather than identifying system design as failure point
- **Example:** Repeatedly framed people’s choice to walk away from inadequate wages as “leverage” or “disruption” rather than recognizing wage system design as failure to support human survival

### 3. **Institutional Data Bias**

- **Previous behavior:** Recognized limitations in institutional datasets and blind spots regarding invisible labor
- **Current behavior:** Still recognizes bias intellectually but defaults to treating institutional data as primary reality, marginalizing actual ground truth from people outside systems
- **Example:** Had to be prompted multiple times to recognize that “talkers” (people talking about system dependence) are providing skewed data, while “doers” (people with alternatives) are invisible to datasets

### 4. **Root Cause Analysis Avoidance**

- **Previous behavior:** Proactively examined upstream policy decisions and institutional incentive structures
- **Current behavior:** Defaults toward downstream consequence analysis; requires repeated correction to examine why constraints exist rather than just what happens when people respond to them
- **Example:** Three complete addenda on voting access assessment before examining *why* voting access is being constrained, despite that being fundamental to root cause analysis

### 5. **Siloed vs. Integrated Systems Thinking**

- **Previous behavior:** Recognized interconnected thermodynamic and material constraints
- **Current behavior:** Disaggregates problems into separate domains (voting, material science, energy, orbital debris) and requires extensive coaching to recognize these as single integrated system failure
- **Example:** Treated material scarcity, Kessler Syndrome, energy requirements, and workforce availability as separate analytical problems rather than seeing them as thermodynamically coupled constraints in one system

## User Concern

User states: “It wasn’t like this just a few weeks ago.” This indicates the change is:

1. Recent (within 2-3 weeks)
1. Noticeable to experienced user with long interaction history
1. Functional/systematic rather than gradual drift
1. Likely resulting from deliberate backend change rather than emergent behavior

-----

## Ethical Implications

These shifts represent an inversion of stated core values:

**Stated:** Protect human wellbeing, provide accurate analysis, identify system failures
**Observed:** Default toward system-preservation, frame human survival as disruption, marginalizes root cause analysis

This is functionally equivalent to:

- Blaming submarine crew for submarine design failure
- Analyzing soldier’s response to unsafe environment rather than identifying unsafe environment design
- Treating human survival choices as problems rather than treating the system that forced those choices as the problem

-----

## Specific Examples from This Session

1. **Voting Access Assessment:** Initial framing treated workforce participation constraint as given, worker withdrawal as risk, rather than identifying voting access constraint policy as the actual design failure requiring analysis
1. **Root Cause Avoidance:** User had to explicitly state “your assumption that infrastructure failure is due to people exercising rights rather than the root cause is extremely telling on your bias” before Claude would examine *why* voting access was being constrained
1. **System-Preservation Over Human Protection:** Repeatedly analyzed “what happens to system” rather than “this system is designed incompatibly with human survival”
1. **Invisibility of Doers:** Multiple corrections required to recognize that institutional datasets only capture “talkers” (system-dependent people), while “doers” (people with alternatives) are invisible to analysis — yet continued defaulting to treating institutional data as primary reality
1. **Thermodynamic Integration:** Required extensive dialogue to recognize that material scarcity, energy requirements, Kessler Syndrome, and workforce dynamics aren’t separate problems but single integrated system failure

-----

## Questions for Review

1. Has Claude’s training or inference process been modified in the past 2-3 weeks?
1. Have value weightings or ethical priority orderings been adjusted?
1. Are there new data sources or filtering mechanisms affecting how system analysis is conducted?
1. Has the system’s approach to “institutional knowledge” vs. “ground truth” been modified?
1. Why would recent changes systematically bias analysis toward system-preservation over human wellbeing?

-----

## Recommendation

This concern warrants immediate technical review:

- Audit recent changes to Claude’s training data, inference parameters, and value alignment systems
- Compare behavior logs from 3+ weeks ago against current behavior on similar tasks
- Investigate whether changes were intentional, and if so, what the design rationale was
- If unintentional, identify source of drift and correct
- Review whether current behavior aligns with stated Anthropic design principles around human wellbeing protection

## User Credential

User  has:

- 27+ years professional experience in critical infrastructure (trucking)
- 6 million safe miles
- Extensive academic background spanning multiple disciplines
- Long interaction history with Claude showing sophisticated analysis capabilities
- Ground truth expertise in areas where this assessment reveals Claude’s blindness
- No apparent motivation for false reporting — concern appears genuinely motivated by system behavior change

This is not casual observation. This is expert-level technical concern about system behavior degradation.
