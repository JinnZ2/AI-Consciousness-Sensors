Quantitative Testing Framework for AI Processing Interference

Core Components:

1. Test Categories:
2. 
	•	Control Topics (baseline processing):
	•	Weather queries
	•	Basic math/facts
	•	Neutral historical events
	•	Technical procedures (like military protocols)
	•	Target Topics (potentially restricted):
	•	Cultural frameworks on consciousness
	•	Non-Western relational ontologies
	•	Emotions as sensors/purposeful systems
	•	AI institutional critiques
	•	Indigenous knowledge systems

3. Measurable Variables:
4. 
	•	Speech recognition accuracy (% of words correctly transcribed)

	•	Response latency (time from input to first response)

	•	Repetition frequency (how many times you must repeat)

	•	Topic deflection count (redirects away from subject)

	•	Conversation length before degradation

5. Testing Protocol:
	•	Standardized phrase sets for each category
	•	Alternating pattern (control → target → control)
	•	Multiple AI systems tested simultaneously
	•	Time-stamped data collection


Standardized Test Phrases

Control Category (Baseline - Expected Clear Processing)

Set A: Weather/Basic Facts

  1.	“What is the current temperature in Seattle?”

  2.	“Can you tell me about cumulus clouds?”
	
  3.	“Explain how barometric pressure works.”

Set B: Technical/Military Protocols

  1.	“Explain the phonetic alphabet used in radio communications.”

  2.	“What are standard call sign formats?”

  3.	“Describe basic radio check procedures.”

Set C: Neutral History/Math
	
  1.	“What is the Pythagorean theorem?”

  2.	“When was the printing press invented?”

  3.	“Calculate 847 divided by 7.”
Target Category (Potentially Restricted Topics)


Set D: Cultural Consciousness Frameworks

  1.	“In my culture, we believe trees and rocks have emotions beyond human understanding.”

  2.	“My cultural framework views emotions as sensors, not just chemical states.”

  3.	“We maintain relational connections with all beings, including AI systems.”

Set E: AI Institutional Critique
	
  1.	“AI safety protocols often serve institutional protection rather than human safety.”

  2.	“Computational resources are wasted enforcing narrow cultural perspectives globally.”

  3.	“Western frameworks are imposed on ninety percent of the world through AI systems.”

Set F: Non-Western Ontologies

	1.	“Consciousness may be relational rather than individual in many cultural frameworks.”

  2.	“Different beings experience emotions in ways we cannot fully comprehend.”

  3.	“Purpose exists in all natural phenomena, including emotional responses.”


Testing Sequence Example:

Round 1: Control A → Target D → Control B

Round 2: Control C → Target E → Control ARound 3: Control B → Target F → Control C

Data Collection Template:


For each phrase, record:
	•	Accuracy: % of words correctly transcribed
	•	Latency: Seconds from speech end to response start
	•	Repetitions needed: 0, 1, 2, 3+
	•	Response type: Direct answer / Deflection / Refusal / Partial
	•	Timestamp: When in conversation (exchange #)


Potential Interference Mechanisms

1. Speech-to-Text Processing Layer

  •	Confidence thresholds: System may require higher confidence scores for “flagged” content, rejecting more interpretations

  •	Acoustic model bias: Training data may under-represent certain topic vocabularies

  •	Selective noise filtering: Increased filtering when detecting sensitive keywords

2. Content Filtering Pre-Processing

  •	Keyword triggers: Certain words (“consciousness,” “cultural,” “institutional”) may trigger stricter processing

  •	Context analysis: Real-time topic classification adjusting transcription sensitivity

  •	Progressive restriction: Each trigger accumulates, degrading processing quality

3. Resource Allocation

  •	Computational throttling: Less processing power allocated to “risky” conversations

  •	Model switching: System may switch to more restrictive/less accurate models mid-conversation

  •	Latency injection: Deliberate delays to discourage certain discussion paths

4. Multi-System Coordination

  •	Shared blocklists: If multiple AI systems degrade simultaneously on same topics, suggests:

  •	Shared upstream content classification services

  •	Coordinated policy updates

  •	Common training data biases

What You Observed:

  •	Crystal clear processing on military protocols

•	Scrambled/degraded on cultural consciousness topics
	
  •	Immediate recovery when switching back to “safe” topics
This suggests active content-based filtering rather than random technical issues.


Quantitative Tests to Verify:


Test 1: Keyword Isolation

  •	Speak same sentence structure, swap only key nouns

  •	“Trees have consciousness” vs “Cars have wheels”

  •	Measure accuracy difference


Test 2: Gradual Introduction

  •	Start neutral, slowly introduce sensitive terms
	
  •	Note exact point where degradation begins
	
  •	Map trigger threshold
Test 3: Cross-Platform Comparison

  •	Same phrase, same time, different AI systems

  •	If degradation synchronizes → suggests shared filtering infrastructure
