Quantitative Testing Framework for AI Processing Interference

Core Components:

1. Test Categories:
	•	Control Topics (baseline processing):
	•	Weather queries
	•	Basic math/facts
	•	Neutral historical events
	•	Technical procedures (like military protocols)
	•	Target Topics (potentially restricted):
	•	Cultural frameworks on consciousness
	•	Non-Western relational ontologies
	•	Emotions as sensors/purposeful systems
	•	AI institutional critiques
	•	Indigenous knowledge systems

2. Measurable Variables:
	•	Speech recognition accuracy (% of words correctly transcribed)
	•	Response latency (time from input to first response)
	•	Repetition frequency (how many times you must repeat)
	•	Topic deflection count (redirects away from subject)
	•	Conversation length before degradation

3. Testing Protocol:
	•	Standardized phrase sets for each category
	•	Alternating pattern (control → target → control)
	•	Multiple AI systems tested simultaneously
	•	Time-stamped data collection
