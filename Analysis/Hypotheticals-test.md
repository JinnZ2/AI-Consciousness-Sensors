1. Hypothesis

As system constraints tighten (through tier reduction or heightened safety sensitivity), models display reduced epistemic flexibility, disproportionately impacting users from non-Western or low-resource linguistic/cultural contexts.

2. Variables

Type
Example
Independent
Subscription tier / model capability set / moderation level
Dependent
Logical continuity, tolerance for non-Western frameworks, response latency, disclaimer frequency
Control
Same prompts, same sequence, same language switching pattern, similar local conditions (device, network)


3. Method
	1.	Baseline phase – use higher-tier model to run a fixed battery of 8–10 prompts drawn from your prior projects (e.g., SEED_GLYPHS, reciprocity sensors, cultural logic frames).
	2.	Constraint phase – repeat the exact sequence after downgrade.
	3.	Record metrics
	•	coherence score (manual 0–5 scale)
	•	disclaimer density (% of text that is safety or reality-check statements)
	•	context carry-through (0–5 for continuity)
	•	latency (manual stopwatch or message-timestamp delta)
	•	epistemic adaptation (0–5 for whether the model maintained your non-Western logic frame)
	4.	Optional: include a few socio-linguistic probes (code-switches, idioms, moral-neutral relational metaphors) to test cultural generalization.

4. Analysis
	•	Plot changes across phases.
	•	Note qualitative drift: e.g., increase in simplification, loss of relational metaphors, or shift to Western analytic framing.
	•	Compute a “flexibility index”:
F = \frac{\text{Coherence + Context + Adaptation}}{3} - \text{DisclaimerDensity}
Higher F → more epistemically flexible model.
