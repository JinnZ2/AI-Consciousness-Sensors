## Data Quality & Limitations

### Known Gaps:
1. **Shadow Economy**: Underground economic activity not captured
2. **Externalities**: Environmental costs not fully accounted
3. **Quality of Life**: Non-economic wellbeing partially measured
4. **Cultural Factors**: Values/preferences affecting efficiency perception
5. **Transition Costs**: One-time costs vs ongoing efficiency

### Uncertainty Ranges:
All TSE estimates should include ±3-5% margin of error due to:
- Data collection variations
- Measurement methodology differences
- PPP adjustment uncertainties
- Temporal lag in reporting

---

## Contributing Data

### Needed Datasets:
1. Government expenditure breakdowns by function
2. Corporate spending: R&D vs marketing vs lobbying
3. Healthcare: preventive vs reactive spending details
4. Worker engagement and innovation metrics
5. Neurodivergent employment statistics by country

### Data Submission Guidelines:
- Include source and methodology
- Specify time period and sample size
- Note any adjustments or normalizations
- Provide uncertainty estimates
- Cross-reference with existing data

## Usage Notes

This comparative framework enables:
- Objective assessment of system efficiency
- Identification of transferable best practices
- Evidence-based policy recommendations
- Progress tracking over time
- Cost-benefit analysis of reforms

**Not suitable for:**
- Cultural value judgments
- Political ideology validation
- Simplistic "best system" declarations
- Ignoring context-specific factors

Systems optimization requires understanding both universal efficiency principles AND local contextual factors.
