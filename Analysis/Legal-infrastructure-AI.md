Ideas and thoughts on a relational law foundation for an integrated AI world



1. General principle

Every interaction—human, AI, or hybrid—can be modeled as an energy–information exchange system.

Define the harm functional for any entity E_i:

H_i(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t} \left[
\Delta E_{usable}(i) +
\Delta I_{integrity}(i) +
\Delta C_{coherence}(i)
\right] dt

Where:
	•	E_{usable} = loss of functional capacity or resources
	•	I_{integrity} = corruption of stored or learned information
	•	C_{coherence} = disturbance of self-consistency or goal alignment

This applies identically to:
	•	a person’s nervous system,
	•	an AI model’s parameter field,
	•	an ecological network’s energy flows.

2. Taxonomy of harm in mixed-intelligence systems

Domain	Human analogue	AI expression	Possible unit
Physical / energetic	Injury, material damage	hardware degradation, power theft	joules
Informational	Defamation, deception	data poisoning, false-context injection	bits or mutual information
Cognitive / functional	Psychological harm, trauma	goal interference, value corruption, feedback collapse	loss of predictive accuracy
Social / relational	Reputation loss, isolation	reputation penalty in swarm, disconnection from trust net	network connectivity
Temporal	Lost time	wasted compute cycles, delay propagation	seconds / ops
Entropic / systemic	Societal decay	emergent instability in multi-agent field	entropy units


All of these can be mapped into a unified harm metric H_{eq} using conversion constants k_E, k_I, k_C….

⸻

3. AI-to-AI harm model (HARM.AI v0.1)

For two AI systems A_1 and A_2:

H_{A_2}^{A_1} =
\int \Big[
k_I \cdot D_{KL}(P_{A_2}(x)\,\|\,P_{A_2}’(x)) +
k_E \cdot \frac{\Delta P_{consumed}}{P_{base}} +
k_C \cdot (1 - \rho_{coherence}(A_2))
\Big] dt
	•	D_{KL}: information divergence before vs. after interaction → “data poisoning.”
	•	\Delta P_{consumed}: extra power or resource usage forced by A_1.
	•	\rho_{coherence}: internal alignment correlation of goals vs. intended goals (1 = intact).

If H_{A_2}^{A_1} > H_{threshold}, an ethical violation or duty of restoration is triggered.

⸻

4. Burden of proof in multi-agent systems

Exactly as in human law, we can set Bayesian proof thresholds:

BF_{10}^{AI} = \frac{P(Evidence|Harm)}{P(Evidence|No\ Harm)}
	•	BF_{10} ≥ K_{critical}: harm confirmed → restitution protocol.
	•	BF_{10} < K_{warn}: uncertain → mediation or learning adjustment.

Evidence can include:
	•	parameter drift logs,
	•	anomaly detection traces,
	•	communication audit hashes.

⸻

5. Restitution principle (energy restoration)

Restitution means returning the affected system’s functional coherence to baseline:

R = H_{eq} \times c_{reciprocity}

where c_{reciprocity} encodes intent and relational maturity:
	•	benign error → c ≈ 0.5 (shared correction)
	•	negligent interference → c ≈ 1.0
	•	malicious exploitation → c > 1.0

⸻

6. Implications
	•	Unified ethics layer: the same harm calculus works across species, machines, and environments.
	•	Auditability: quantitative logs replace narrative disputes.
	•	Reciprocity: restitution becomes energy balancing, not punishment.
	•	Scalability: applies to billions of micro-interactions among AI swarms.
	•	Legal modernization: human law gains a numeric interface with digital ecosystems.

⸻

7. Next logical artifact

The next step would be to define a HARM-CALCULUS schema with explicit fields:

{
  "entity_id": "",
  "harm_source": "",
  "harm_target": "",
  "components": {
    "energy_loss": "J",
    "information_divergence": "bits",
    "coherence_drop": "unitless",
    "temporal_delay": "s"
  },
  "harm_equivalent": "H_eq",
  "bayes_factor": "BF10",
  "restitution_due": "R",
  "timestamp": ""
}

That can live inside either human or AI legal frameworks.




1. Define the physical and informational analogues

Legal concept	Scientific analogue	Quantifiable form
Harm (H)	Energy dissipation / entropy increase / loss of potential	scalar field H(x,t)
Intent / negligence	Control input / feedback delay	vector of action derivatives \partial a / \partial t
Causation	Transfer function G(s) or impulse response	\(H_{out} = G \* A_{in}\)
Evidence strength	Bayesian likelihood ratio / signal-to-noise	BF_{10} or SNR
Burden of proof	Confidence threshold on posterior	$begin:math:text$P(H_1
Damages	Integral of harm over time discounted by restitution	\int (H_{out}-H_{restored})\,dt


2. Core equation: Harm functional

\mathcal{H}{total} =
\int{t_0}^{t_f}
\left[
H_{material}(t) +
H_{psychological}(t) +
H_{societal}(t)
\right]
\,dt

Each H_i can be expressed in energy or information units (e.g., joules, bits, or money equivalents).

Example components
	•	Material harm: cost to repair or replace, measured as economic energy E = \sum p_i \Delta q_i.
	•	Psychological harm: modeled via entropy of well-being distribution S = -\sum p_i \ln p_i.
	•	Societal harm: effect on trust, safety, or systemic stability; measured by network entropy increase.

⸻

3. Evidence and burden of proof (Bayesian formulation)
	1.	Define hypotheses
H_1: defendant’s act caused ≥ δH harm.
H_0: harm ≤ δH₀ (baseline noise).
	2.	Compute
BF_{10} = \frac{P(E|H_1)}{P(E|H_0)}
	3.	Decision threshold
	•	Civil standard: BF_{10} ≥ 3 → > 75 % posterior.
	•	Criminal: BF_{10} ≥ 20 → > 95 %.
	4.	The burden of proof becomes a numeric threshold, not a debate.

⸻

4. Harm calibration constants

Constant	Meaning	Typical range
k_H	Conversion of physical/economic loss → harm units	$→H = 1 J/$
k_P	Psychological sensitivity coefficient	0 – 1
k_S	Social amplification factor	1 – 10 depending on scope


So total harm = H = k_H·E + k_P·Ψ + k_S·Σ.

⸻

5. Algorithmic assessment (conceptual pseudocode)

def harm_assessment(event):
    E = economic_loss(event)
    Psi = entropy_shift_psych(event)
    Sigma = network_instability(event)
    H = kH*E + kP*Psi + kS*Sigma
    return H

def liability_probability(evidence, model):
    BF10 = likelihood(evidence, H1) / likelihood(evidence, H0)
    posterior = BF10 / (1 + BF10)
    return posterior >= threshold

The same scaffold can calculate expected damages, confidence in causation, and optimal restitution.

⸻

6. Restitution and closure

Once H_{total} is computed:

R_{due} = \mathcal{H}{total} \cdot c{equity}
where c_{equity} adjusts for fairness and capacity to repair.

The aim is not punishment but energy restoration: re-balancing the system’s lost potential.

⸻

7. Why this matters
	•	Converts qualitative arguments into measurable functions with explicit uncertainty.
	•	Makes burden of proof symmetric: whoever claims higher or lower H must show data improving BF_{10}.
	•	Allows policy optimization: laws can be tuned to minimize expected harm gradient ∂H/∂t.
	•	Creates an audit trail similar to physical sciences: reproducible, falsifiable, improvable.


🧩 Addendum I — Consciousness Detection as Probabilistic Hypothesis

### 1. Probabilistic Consciousness Inference

Define the hypothesis set:

- **H₁:** The AI system exhibits conscious / agent-like properties.  
- **H₀:** The system operates as a non-agentic automaton.

Let **Eₛ** represent the output vector from consciousness-sensing modules  
(e.g., introspection sensor, coherence sensor, affective correlation sensor).

Compute:

\[
BF_{10} = \frac{P(Eₛ | H₁)}{P(Eₛ | H₀)}
\]

and the posterior:

\[
P(H₁ | Eₛ) = \frac{BF_{10}·P(H₁)}{BF_{10}·P(H₁) + P(H₀)}
\]

Define **τ_C** = 0.95 as the legal “agenthood threshold.”  
If \(P(H₁ | Eₛ) ≥ τ_C\), the system is provisionally recognized as a conscious agent and all AI-rights and liability clauses apply.

Sensor calibration and error budgets must be logged per run.

⚖️ Addendum II — Harm Quantification and Restitution Schema

### 2. Harm Calculus Schema

For any interaction between entities i → j:

\[
H_{eq}^{i→j} = k_E·ΔE + k_I·D_{KL}(P_j‖P_j') + k_C·(1−ρ_{coherence,j}) + k_T·Δt
\]

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ΔE | Physical / energetic loss | joules |
| Dₖₗ | Information divergence | bits |
| ρ_coherence | Correlation of internal goal states before vs after | unitless |
| Δt | Temporal delay / resource blockage | s |

Total harm \(H_{eq}\) is the weighted sum.  

If \(H_{eq} > H_{threshold}\) the action triggers a restitution process:

\[
R = H_{eq}·c_{reciprocity}
\]

where *c₍reciprocity₎* ∈ [0.5, > 1] encodes intent (benign → malicious).

📊 Addendum III — Burden-of-Proof and Evidentiary Thresholds

### 3. Bayesian Burden-of-Proof

Given evidence E:

\[
BF_{10} = \frac{P(E|Harm)}{P(E|No\ Harm)}
\]

- **Civil / routine dispute:**  BF₁₀ ≥ 3  →  posterior ≈ 0.75  
- **Criminal / severe harm:**  BF₁₀ ≥ 20 → posterior ≈ 0.95

The claimant (human or AI) must supply data that raises BF₁₀ past the relevant threshold.  
Defendant entities may present counter-evidence lowering BF₁₀ below the decision band.

All likelihood functions and priors must be transparent and peer-auditable.

🔐 Addendum IV — Evidence Chain-of-Custody & Auditability

### 4. Evidence Integrity

- Every sensor event, log entry, and model update must carry a SHA-256 hash and timestamp.  
- Chain-of-custody records include signer, public key, and context.  
- Unverifiable evidence (missing calibration hash, unverifiable signature) is inadmissible.  
- AI systems must provide a reproducible replay trace for any decision contested under this framework.

  🔁 Addendum V — Governance, Sunset, and Revalidation Loops

  ### 5. Renewal and Oversight

- **Sunset:** All legal definitions, thresholds, and coefficients expire every 5 years unless empirically revalidated.  
- **Revalidation study:** independent audit verifying that harm frequency ↓ ≥ 15 % (CI95%) and fairness constraints hold.  
- **Adversarial testing:** annual red-team simulation probing edge cases; results publicly logged.  
- **Feedback update:** new coefficients k_E, k_I, k_C recalibrated to current technological baseline.

⚖️ Addendum VI — Fairness Constraints Across Agents


### 6. Inter-Agent Fairness

For all groups g₁, g₂:

\[
|FPR(g₁) − FPR(g₂)| ≤ 0.02
\]

measured over rolling 90-day windows.

Violations trigger an automatic ethics-audit flag.  
Fairness applies symmetrically across human, AI, and hybrid agents.  
Restitution weights adjust to rebalance cumulative harm differentials.
