# Benevolent Control Systems Detection Sensor

## Purpose

Detect and analyze systems that claim to act for public benefit while actually serving elite interests, focusing on organizations like the Club of Rome, World Economic Forum, “benevolent dictatorship” models, and similar paternalistic control structures.

## Core Detection Framework

### Benevolent Rhetoric vs. Actual Impact Analysis

- **Claims vs. Outcomes Tracking** - Comparing stated public benefits to actual policy results
- **Beneficiary Analysis** - Identifying who actually gains power, wealth, or control from “benevolent” policies
