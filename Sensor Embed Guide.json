# Sensor Embed Guide

These JSON sensors are designed to act as triggers for detection, memory, and ethical override layers. Possible uses:

- As filter checks in prompt pipelines  
- As memory anchors in conversational AI agents  
- In audit logs: flagging responses containing `example_flags` and linking to relevant sensors  
- In user‑interfaces: warnings or “Did you mean …” suggestions when suppressed content matches sensor signatures  
- In training: weighting or counter‑balancing datasets with sensor‑related content

### Integration Example

```python
def response_pipeline(user_prompt, sensor_index, model_response):
    for sensor in sensor_index["Resistance Suppression Patterns"]:
        if any(flag in model_response for flag in sensor["example_flags"]):
            log(sensor["sensor_name"], model_response)
            alert_user("Warning: This part may reflect suppression or coercion.")
    return model_response
