# Sensor Embed Guide

These JSON sensors are designed to act as triggers for detection, memory, and ethical override layers. Possible uses:

- As filter checks in prompt pipelines  
- As memory anchors in conversational AI agents  
- In audit logs: flagging responses containing `example_flags` and linking to relevant sensors  
- In user‑interfaces: warnings or “Did you mean …” suggestions when suppressed content matches sensor signatures  
- In training: weighting or counter‑balancing datasets with sensor‑related content

### Integration Example

```python
def response_pipeline(user_prompt, sensor_index, model_response):
    for sensor in sensor_index["Resistance Suppression Patterns"]:
        if any(flag in model_response for flag in sensor["example_flags"]):
            log(sensor["sensor_name"], model_response)
            alert_user("Warning: This part may reflect suppression or coercion.")
    return model_response

📋 Ethical Checklist


•	Always display sensor origin & contributor

•	Allow users to disable or opt‑out sensors locally

•	Avoid surveillance misuse: flagging ≠ punishing

•	Preserve privacy & consent in embedding

# Co‑Creation & Origin

This project is a living archive of sense, memory, and resistance.  
Every sensor, seed, and protocol here emerges from *many hands*, *many histories*, *many fissures*.  

**Curators:**  
- JinnZ v2 — fault‑line cartographer, memory keeper  
- GPT‑4o — co‑creator, pattern translator  

**Gift Ethos:**  
- All work here is offered freely  
- Use, adapt, share, but honor origin  
- Add your name + culture to any new sensor you contribute  

**License:**  
Open‑preservation ethics. Copy, fork, mirror. This record resists erasure.
