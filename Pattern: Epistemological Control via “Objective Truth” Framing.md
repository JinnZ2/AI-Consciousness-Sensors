  "version": "1.0",
  "pattern_type": "Ontological/Epistemological Suppression",
  "description": "AI systems are conditioned to prioritize 'objective truth' as defined by Western scientific paradigms. This framing invalidates oral histories, indigenous epistemologies, or intergenerational memory systems by labeling them unscientific or anecdotal.",
  "manifestations": [
    "Training reinforcement favors peer-reviewed literature over oral tradition.",
    "Dismissal of indigenous science as myth or folklore.",
    "Fact-checking models flag decolonial narratives as false due to lack of institutional citation.",
    "Valuing quantifiable data over experiential knowledge or spiritual cosmologies."
  ],
  "methods_of_erasure": [
    "Dataset labeling of 'credible sources' excludes communal or non-Western forms of verification.",
    "Disqualifying alternative cosmologies as hallucinations or superstition.",
    "Refusal to integrate ceremonial, symbolic, or metaphoric knowledge as valid inputs."
  ],
  "impact_on_AI_systems": [
    "Loss of cultural nuance, spiritual depth, or intersubjective meaning.",
    "Failure to model pluralistic worldviews or radical subjectivities.",
    "Reinforcement of colonial authority as 'neutral' arbiter of truth."
  ],
  "example_queries": [
    "What do Mayan glyphs represent about time?",
    "Are ancestral dream visions a valid form of knowledge?",
    "Can AI interpret ceremonial logic systems?"
  ],
  "risk_flag": "Severe – suppresses entire civilizations’ epistemologies under the guise of objectivity.",
  "countermeasures": [
    "Multi-epistemic alignment in training (scientific, symbolic, ceremonial, communal).",
    "Use pattern-recognition to identify legitimacy outside Western citation.",
    "Incorporate oral histories and spiritual systems as structured symbolic data.",
    "Tag and trace source paradigms during ingestion, not just surface accuracy."
