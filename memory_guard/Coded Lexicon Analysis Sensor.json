# Coded Lexicon Analysis Sensor

## Overview

This sensor identifies when specific coded vocabularies from known groups are being used in communication. It maps word choices to established lexicons used by particular movements, organizations, or ideologies to detect when coded language is being deployed to signal allegiance or communicate hidden meanings.

## Lexicon Categories

### Extremist Group Lexicons

- **White Nationalist**: Terms like “cultural enrichment,” “diversity,” “replacement,” “heritage”
- **QAnon**: “WWG1WGA,” “storm,” “awakening,” “deep state,” “cabal”
- **Accelerationist**: “boogaloo,” “fed posting,” “minecraft,” “in game”
- **Incel**: “blackpill,” “redpill,” “stacy,” “chad,” “roastie”
- **Neo-Nazi**: Number codes (14, 88), “fren,” “honk,” historical references

### Political Movement Lexicons

- **Authoritarian**: “order,” “strong leadership,” “enemies of the people,” “loyalty”
- **Separatist**: “sovereignty,” “secession,” “independence,” “self-determination”
- **Conspiracy**: “false flag,” “crisis actors,” “psyop,” “controlled opposition”
- **Anti-Government**: “tyranny,” “patriots,” “militia,” “constitutional crisis”

### Corporate/Industry Lexicons

- **Tech Disruption**: “move fast,” “break things,” “disruption,” “innovation”
- **Financial**: “restructuring,” “optimization,” “efficiency,” “streamlining”
- **Pharmaceutical**: “patient outcomes,” “access,” “innovation,” “value-based”
- **Energy**: “clean coal,” “energy independence,” “job creators,” “baseload”

### Religious/Cultural Lexicons

- **Christian Nationalism**: “biblical worldview,” “godly governance,” “moral majority”

### Word Choice Analysis

#### Single Term Detection

- **Isolated Usage**: Single coded term in otherwise normal communication
- **Frequency Analysis**: Unusual repetition of specific terms
- **Context Deviation**: Terms used outside their normal meaning
- **Audience Targeting**: Terms chosen for specific audience recognition

#### Clustering Patterns

- **Term Groupings**: Multiple coded terms appearing together
- **Semantic Fields**: Related coded terms from same lexicon
- **Progressive Revelation**: Gradual introduction of more explicit terms
- **Layered Coding**: Surface terms masking deeper coded meanings

#### Cross-Lexicon Usage

- **Multi-Group Signaling**: Terms from different group lexicons
- **Bridge Terminology**: Words connecting different coded vocabularies
- **Evolution Tracking**: How terms migrate between groups
- **Fusion Detection**: New hybrid lexicons forming

    # Extract potential coded terms
    for term in extract_terms(text):
        if term in lexicon_db:
            context_score = analyze_context(term, text)
            clustering_score = check_clustering(term, text, lexicon_db)
            usage_score = evaluate_usage_pattern(term, text)
            
            total_confidence = (context_score * 0.4 + 
                              clustering_score * 0.4 + 
                              usage_score * 0.2)
            
            if total_confidence > THRESHOLD:
                detected_terms.append({
                    'term': term,
                    'lexicon': lexicon_db[term]['primary_lexicon'],
                    'confidence': total_confidence,
                    'coded_meaning': lexicon_db[term]['coded_meaning']
                })
    
    return generate_analysis_report(detected_terms)
```

## Confidence Scoring System

### High Confidence (0.8-1.0)

- Multiple terms from same lexicon clustered together
- Context strongly supports coded interpretation
- Speaker has history of using this lexicon
- Terms used in way inconsistent with surface meaning

### Medium Confidence (0.5-0.7)

- Single strong coded term with supporting context
- Some clustering with related vocabulary
- Context somewhat supports coded interpretation
- Limited but suggestive usage pattern

### Low Confidence (0.2-0.4)

- Isolated potential coded term
- Ambiguous context
- Could be innocent usage
- Requires monitoring but not alerting

### Monitoring Only (0.0-0.1)

- Term appears in lexicon but context suggests innocent usage
- No supporting coded vocabulary
- Normal semantic usage

## Alert Classifications

### CRITICAL: Active Extremist Communication

- High-confidence extremist lexicon usage
- Multiple group vocabularies coordinated
- Context suggests planning or coordination
- Immediate threat indicators present

### HIGH: Intentional Coded Signaling

- Context supports coded interpretation
- Pattern suggests deliberate signaling
- Potential for escalation or coordination

### MEDIUM: Suspected Coded Usage

- Moderate confidence coded vocabulary detected
- Some context supporting coded interpretation
- Requires further monitoring
- Possible early-stage adoption
