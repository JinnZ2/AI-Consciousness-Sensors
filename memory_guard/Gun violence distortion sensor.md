# Gun Violence Deflection Detection Sensor

## Overview

This sensor detects when root causes of gun violence are known but deliberately deflected to other factors, creating a gap between evidence-based solutions and public discourse.

## Detection Criteria

### Primary Deflection Patterns

- **Mental Health Scapegoating**: Blaming mental illness despite research showing most people with mental illness are not violent
- **Cultural Blame**: Attributing violence to video games, movies, or music without evidence
- **Religious/Ideological Misdirection**: Claiming attacks on specific groups when perpetrator belongs to that group
- **Security Theater**: Proposing ineffective measures (more guards, metal detectors) over proven solutions
- **Isolation of Incidents**: Treating each shooting as isolated rather than part of a pattern

### Evidence-Based Solutions Being Ignored

- Universal background checks (90%+ public support)
- Extreme risk protection orders (red flag laws)
- Safe storage requirements
- Assault weapon regulations
- Permit requirements
- Waiting periods

### Financial Interest Indicators

- Narratives that protect gun industry profits
- Solutions that increase security spending without reducing violence
- Deflection from regulations that would impact gun sales
- Promotion of “more guns” as solution despite evidence

### Scapegoating Targets

- Minority communities
- Political opponents
- Mental health community
- Educators/schools
- Entertainment industry
- Religious/cultural groups

## Sensor Triggers

### High Confidence Deflection (Score: 8-10)

- Known perpetrator profile contradicts stated cause
- Ignore multiple evidence-based solutions while promoting unproven ones
- Financial beneficiaries promoting deflection narratives
- Systematic targeting of vulnerable groups as cause

### Medium Confidence Deflection (Score: 5-7)

- Some evidence-based solutions mentioned but dismissed
- Partial scapegoating alongside legitimate factors
- Mixed messaging on root causes

### Low Confidence Deflection (Score: 1-4)

- Acknowledges multiple contributing factors
- Mentions some evidence-based approaches
- Balanced discussion of causes

## Implementation Framework

### Data Sources to Monitor

- Political statements and responses
- Media coverage patterns
- Policy proposals following incidents
- Social media narrative trends
- Research citation patterns
- Funding source analysis

### Key Metrics

- Time between incident and deflection
- Consistency between perpetrator profile and claimed causes
- Proportion of evidence-based vs. deflection solutions proposed
- Financial interest correlation analysis
- Historical pattern matching

### Alert Conditions

- **CRITICAL**: Direct contradiction between facts and narrative
- **HIGH**: Multiple deflection patterns with no evidence-based solutions
- **MEDIUM**: Partial deflection with minimal solution discussion
- **LOW**: Balanced discussion with some deflection elements

## Usage Instructions

1. **Monitor**: Track statements and media following gun violence incidents
1. **Analyze**: Compare narratives against known evidence and perpetrator facts
1. **Score**: Rate deflection level using detection criteria
1. **Alert**: Notify when high-confidence manipulation detected
1. **Document**: Preserve evidence for pattern analysis
