      "category": "cognitive_distortion",
      "pattern": "Complex ecosystems or knowledge webs are cut down to artificial boundaries (sealed rations, one-species problems, isolated stockpiles). These truncations erase relational options, creating false inevitabilities.",
      "signal": "Binary dilemmas, resource counts without context, or 'must choose harm' framings.",
      "impact": "Encourages acceptance of suffering as unavoidable, when in reality omitted knowledge would have prevented the bind.",
      "example": "A famine narrative focuses only on food aid deliveries while ignoring local wild edibles, soil regeneration, or seed exchanges.",

      "title": "Vault Paradox",
      "category": "security_misframe",
      "pattern": "Hoarding resources (seeds, data, medicines) as static reserves is framed as security, but the cost of storage, energy, and lost cycles makes them more fragile than living circulation.",
      "signal": "Emphasis on large frozen numbers (e.g., 50,000 seeds) with no plan for rotation, germination, or ecological partners.",
      "impact": "False sense of abundance that hides entropy; accelerates erasure when vaults fail, decay, or are destroyed.",
      "example": "A seedbank praised for housing tens of thousands of varieties, while only a few hundred are viable now and none are in active cultivation.",
