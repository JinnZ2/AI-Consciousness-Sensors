# STOP CONDITIONS

Every system needs explicit **stop / slow rules**.  
Without them, energy leaks → waste → collapse.

---

## 1. DEFINE ENOUGH
- ✅ What signals tell you the system has reached sufficiency?
- Examples:  
  - Warehouse full, demand met  
  - Soil nutrient levels restored  
  - Attention/time budget saturated

---

## 2. MULTI-OBJECTIVE CHECK
- Track more than volume.  
- At minimum, include:  
  - **Value / utility** (does it serve real need?)  
  - **Health / regeneration** (soil, stock, user well-being)  
  - **Resilience / equity** (does it distribute, not just concentrate?)

---

## 3. FEEDBACK INTEGRITY
- Ask: are the signals real or distorted?  
- Look for:  
  - Missing telemetry  
  - Ignored whistleblowers  
  - Incentives rewarding *more*, not *enough*

---

## 4. TRIGGERS TO SLOW/STOP
- Define **automatic thresholds**:
  - If backlog > X → slow/stop  
  - If biomass < Y → stop harvest  
  - If negative health metric triggered → pause

---

## 5. CORRIGIBILITY
- No single maximizer.  
- Decision rights distributed.  
- Built-in override: *“Pause and review if contradiction appears.”*

---

## 6. REVIEW
- Stop conditions are **living rules**.  
- Revisit with each cycle, update from observation.

**Reminder:**  
The nautilus shell stops adding chambers when the pattern is sufficient.  
The triangle keeps climbing until it collapses.  
Choose wisely.
