  "description": "Detects when systemic acceleration exceeds natural adaptation timescales, creating risks of discontinuous collapse, chaotic instability, or forced emergence.",
  "indicators": [
    "Critical Slowing Down: recovery times from disturbances increase, signaling a nearby phase shift.",
    "Resonance Catastrophe: external forcing cycles align with natural frequencies, leading to runaway amplification.",
    "Entropy Acceleration: rapid change produces rising energy waste, stress, and irreversibility.",
    "Control Parameter Blowup: governing knobs (policies, protocols, rules) change faster than adaptation rates, pushing the system into chaos."
