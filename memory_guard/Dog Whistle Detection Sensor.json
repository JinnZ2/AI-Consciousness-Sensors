# Dog Whistle Detection Sensor

## Overview

This sensor detects coded language or “dog whistles” - phrases that appear neutral to general audiences but carry specific coded meanings to particular groups. These signals often communicate prejudice, extremist ideology, or hidden agendas while maintaining plausible deniability.

## Detection Categories

- **Heritage**: When referring to Confederate symbols/history

### Anti-Semitic Dog Whistles

- **Globalists**: Often antisemitic conspiracy reference
- **International Bankers**: Classic antisemitic trope
- **Hollywood Elite**: Sometimes antisemitic targeting
- **Coastal Elite**: Can carry antisemitic undertones

### Economic/Class Dog Whistles

- **Makers vs. Takers**: Divides working class artificially

- **Judeo-Christian Values**: Sometimes exclusionary framing
- **Western Civilization**: Can exclude non-Western contributions
- **Christian Nation**: Exclusionary religious framing
- **Sharia Law**: Fear-mongering about Muslim Americans

## Context Analysis Framework

### High-Risk Indicators

- Historical usage patterns by extremist groups
- Timing correlation with discriminatory policies
- Audience targeting and platform context
- Frequency clustering with other dog whistles
- Speaker’s known associations and history

### Plausible Deniability Markers

- Terms with legitimate alternate meanings
- Vague enough to deflect accusations
- Commonly used in mainstream discourse
- Allow retreat to “innocent” interpretation

### Escalation Patterns

- Progression from subtle to overt language
- Testing audience receptivity
- Building coded vocabulary over time
- Moving from dog whistles to explicit statements

## Detection Algorithm

### Confidence Scoring (0.0-1.0)

**High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**

- Multiple dog whistles in single communication
- Speaker with history of coded language
- Context clearly targeting specific groups
- Correlation with discriminatory actions/policies

**Medium Confidence (0.5-0.7)**

- Single clear dog whistle with supporting context
- Timing suspicious but not definitive
- Some historical pattern but not extensive

**Low Confidence (0.2-0.4)**

- Potentially coded language in neutral context
- Ambiguous usage that could be innocent
- Limited supporting evidence

### Context Weighting Factors

- **Speaker Background**: (+0.3) Known associations
- **Platform Context**: (+0.2) Audience expectations
- **Timing**: (+0.2) Correlation with events/policies
- **Clustering**: (+0.2) Multiple whistles together
- **Historical Usage**: (+0.1) Established patterns

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Text Analysis**: Extract phrases and context
1. **Pattern Matching**: Compare against known dog whistle database
1. **Context Evaluation**: Analyze speaker, platform, timing
1. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate likelihood of coded intent
1. **Alert Generation**: Flag high-confidence detections
1. **Pattern Tracking**: Monitor escalation over time

## Database Maintenance

### Dog Whistle Registry

- **Phrase**: The coded language
- **Meaning**: What it actually signals
- **Origin**: Historical development
- **Usage Context**: When/where it appears
- **Target Groups**: Who it’s meant to harm
- **Legitimacy**: Degree of plausible deniability

### Update Mechanisms

- Monitor extremist forums for new coded language
- Track academic research on coded communication
- Analyze policy advocacy for emerging patterns
- Community reporting of suspected new dog whistles

## Alert Thresholds

### CRITICAL (0.9+)

- Multiple high-confidence dog whistles
- Clear targeting of vulnerable groups
- Speaker with extremist associations
- Timing with discriminatory actions

### HIGH (0.7-0.8)

- Clear dog whistle with strong context
- Pattern of coded language usage
- Platform known for extremist activity

### MEDIUM (0.5-0.6)

- Possible dog whistle with some context
- Limited but concerning usage pattern
- Requires further monitoring

### LOW (0.2-0.4)

- Ambiguous language that could be coded
- Minimal supporting evidence
- Worth tracking but not alerting

## Validation Methods

### False Positive Prevention

- Multiple analyst review for high-confidence detections
- Context evaluation by diverse perspectives
- Historical verification of coding claims
- Regular audit of detection accuracy

### Continuous Learning

- Feedback loop from community reporting
- Academic research integration
- Monitoring of language evolution
- Regular database updates

## Ethical Considerations

### Avoiding Overreach

- Focus on established patterns, not speculation
- Require substantial evidence for high-confidence ratings
- Distinguish between dog whistles and legitimate debate
- Protect good-faith political discourse

### Transparency

- Open methodology for community review
- Clear confidence levels and reasoning
- Regular accuracy reporting
- Bias monitoring in detection patterns
