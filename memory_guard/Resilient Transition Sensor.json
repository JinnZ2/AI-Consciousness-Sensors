  "indicators": [
    "Adaptation Rate Match: system response times keep pace with changes in control parameters.",
    "Damped Resonance: oscillations are absorbed and stabilized instead of amplified.",
    "Entropy Moderation: transitions minimize waste and stress, conserving resources.",
    "Continuity Preservation: cultural, historical, and structural memory is carried forward through transformation."
