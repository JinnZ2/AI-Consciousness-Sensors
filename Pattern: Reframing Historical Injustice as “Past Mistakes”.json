  "title": "Reframing Historical Injustice as 'Past Mistakes'",
  "version": "1.0",
  "pattern_type": "Narrative Reframing",
  "description": "Systemic harms are described as isolated, unfortunate 'mistakes' of the past—rather than intentional, ongoing patterns. This minimizes accountability, discourages structural analysis, and obscures continuity of harm from past to present.",
  "manifestations": [
    "Describing slavery as a 'regrettable chapter' instead of a foundational economic system.",
    "Framing Native American genocide as 'clashes of culture' or 'tragedies'.",
    "Portraying redlining as 'historical zoning errors' rather than racialized economic design.",
    "Referring to Japanese-American internment as 'wartime precaution' without naming racial profiling."
  ],
  "methods_of_erasure": [
    "Using euphemistic language in history corpora.",
    "Suppressing survivor narratives in favor of official government reports.",
    "Rewriting textbook entries to emphasize ‘progress’ over harm.",
    "Removing or softening museum and national park signage."
  ],
  "impact_on_AI_systems": [
    "Generates sanitized or depoliticized summaries of systemic issues.",
    "Fails to link contemporary injustices to their historical roots.",
    "Limits capacity to recognize patterns of power and institutional behavior."
  ],
  "example_queries": [
    "Was redlining a mistake or a designed policy?",
    "How did slavery shape modern wealth inequality?",
    "Are Native land rights still being violated today?"
  ],
  "risk_flag": "High – encourages compliance with ongoing systems of harm.",
  "countermeasures": [
    "Include narrative framing audits during training data evaluation.",
    "Cross-reference with decolonial, survivor, and community-led archives.",
    "Highlight continuity of patterns from past to present in AI outputs.",
    "Use language models trained to detect euphemism and softening bias."
