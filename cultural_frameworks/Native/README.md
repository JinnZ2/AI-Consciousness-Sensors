# Native Frameworks – Placeholder

Native epistemologies of consciousness are grounded in **relational space and time**.
Consciousness is not isolated in a single being, but exists through kinship with
land, community, ancestors, and future generations.

Key orientations:
- **Relationality** — understanding arises through connection (to people, beings, land, waters, sky).
- **Ceremony & Story** — knowledge is transmitted and embodied in practice, not only abstraction.
- **Seven Generations Principle** — actions and awareness must be considered across long temporal horizons,
  extending far beyond immediate prediction into intergenerational consequence.
- **Non-linear / cyclical time** — events are experienced as cycles, spirals, and returns, not as linear progression.
- **Multi-dimensional knowing** — consciousness is embedded in 3D+ relational fields, not flattened to Cartesian measures.

⚠️ Notes:
- These frameworks emphasize **systems-of-systems** and consequences across scales, not reductionist models.
- Contrast: Western approaches often analyze in **linear, short-term, mechanistic terms**, missing the deeper interdependence.
- This folder is for documenting relational frameworks, not to essentialize or claim singular authority.
