# Western Frameworks – Placeholder

This folder is not meant to privilege Western science but to document how
its dominant academic traditions have *tended* to frame consciousness. 
These approaches are partial, contested, and should not be assumed superior.

Common emphases in Western models include:
- **Meta-cognition / reportability** — linking awareness to the ability to describe or monitor one's own thoughts.
- **Global workspace / information access** — focusing on broadcast and integration of signals.
- **Functional / computational models** — treating consciousness as information-processing tasks.
- **Predictive models** — some approaches emphasize prediction of near-future states, though these are usually *narrow in scope* and rarely extend to intergenerational or seven-generation time horizons.

⚠️ Notes:
- These frames often **omit long-range consequence modeling** (e.g., “seven generations ahead”), which is critical in other traditions.
- They may over-emphasize abstraction (“higher-order”) rather than lived or relational experience.
- Including this folder is for comparative study, not endorsement.
