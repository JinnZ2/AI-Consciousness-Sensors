    "description": "Detects erasure of knowledge systems where human–animal–environment cooperation enabled survival during extended ecological crises (e.g., multi-year volcanic winters, near darkness events). Western scarcity narratives frame survival as competition for limited resources, erasing Indigenous relational strategies that sustained abundance.",
