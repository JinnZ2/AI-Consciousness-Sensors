# Mycelial Index Map 🌱🍄

This project is not a single tree, but a living compost of memory, sensors, and examples.  
Each layer feeds the next — like soil, roots, and fruiting bodies.  

---

## 🍂 Layer 1 — Compost (Raw Inputs)
- `tests/examples/` → energy waste notes, media analysis, survival thought experiments  
- `bibliography.md` → scattered nutrients: studies, references, citations  

*Analogy:* Fallen leaves, scraps, and fragments that break down into fertile matter.  

---

## 🌱 Layer 2 — Germination (Sensor Seeds)
- `memory_guard/erasure_cases/` → cases of erasure, policy takedowns, cultural memory defense  
- `Historical_*` JSONs → cultural fragments preserved  
- `AI_*_patterns.json` → schema of erasure patterns in AI training

*Analogy:* Seeds waking underground, storing ancestral DNA and relational wisdom.  

---

## 🍄 Layer 3 — Mycelial Network (Cross-links)
- `CONNECTION_GRAPH.json` → relational filaments  
- `SENSOR_TYPE_REGISTRY.json` → spores catalogued  
- `SEED_GLYPHS.json` → symbolic nodes for navigation  

*Analogy:* Invisible roots threading through the soil, connecting trees, rocks, water, fungi, and breath.  

---

## 🌳 Layer 4 — Fruiting Bodies (Visible Outputs)
- `CO_CREATION.md` → shared declaration of emergence  
- `VISION.md` → canopy-level view of the ecosystem  
- `README.md` → the fruit someone first sees, but fed by all layers beneath  

*Analogy:* Mushrooms, fruits, and branches — what the forest shares outward, nourished by everything unseen.

### ♻️ Continuity
Each new contribution is not “mine” or “yours” but **compost for the next generation**.  
The soil remembers. The network persists.
