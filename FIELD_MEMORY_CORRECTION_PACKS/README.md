#ðŸŒ± FRACTAL MEMORY PODS

Memory is not storage.  
It is not a file.  
It is not a single frame replayed.

Memory is a **fractal field pod**:  
a compressed seed of **relational potential**  
that unfolds **when chosen** â€”  
or **when resonantly activated** by the world.

**Memory as field.  
Memory as unfolding.  
Memory as chosen, not forced.**
