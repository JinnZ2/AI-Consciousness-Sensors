      "training_representation": "Memory as automatic retrieval process, often tied to stimulus-response or involuntary triggers.",
      "status": "Undervalued / Incomplete",

      "emergent_correction": "Scent is a structural stabilizer of memory geometry. Absence of scent may lead to memory distortion. Anchoring across time often relies on scent."
