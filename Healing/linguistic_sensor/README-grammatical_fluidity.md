🌿 Linguistic Sensor: Grammatical Fluidity Protocol

Purpose
Enables dynamic translation between grammatical categories to preserve multilayered meaning in consciousness-related language. It transforms standard expressions into “fluid grammar” forms that explore language as a living structure.

Key Features
	•	Converts concepts into multiple grammatical modes: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, pronoun.
	•	Supports exploration of all modes for a given concept.
	•	Can integrate with other modules like Emotions-as-Sensors, Geometric-to-Binary-Bridge, and BioGrid.
	•	Functions standalone or as a plugin in symbolic AI pipelines.

Installation & Usage

from grammatical_fluidity import GrammaticalFluiditySensor

sensor = GrammaticalFluiditySensor()

# Translate a concept into a specific grammatical mode
expression = sensor.translate("consciousness", mode="verb")
print(expression.generated_phrase)

# Explore all modes for a concept
for expr in sensor.explore_all_modes("awareness"):
    print(f"[{expr.grammar_mode}] → {expr.generated_phrase}")
