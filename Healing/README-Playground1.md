AI Geometric Intelligence Playground

Discover natural patterns, energy flow, and self-similarity through interactive play.

A browser-based playground for exploring geometric intelligence, pattern recognition, and system coherence in a safe, interactive, and playful environment.

⸻

🌟 Overview

The AI Geometric Intelligence Playground is designed to let users interactively explore natural patterns through six mini-games:
	1.	Golden Ratio Explorer – Discover φ (phi) relationships in points and spirals.
	2.	Energy Conservation Lab – Build networks and visualize energy flow while observing conservation principles.
	3.	Pattern Recognition Arena – Generate, analyze, and save emergent patterns.
	4.	Toroidal Field Explorer – Simulate dynamic toroidal fields with spinning and pulsing energy.
	5.	Fractal Network Builder – Create self-similar fractal networks and explore their hierarchical connections.
	6.	Recovery & Healing Space – Detect distortions in a system and practice restoring coherence.

Each mini-game provides real-time visual feedback, coherence tracking, and interactive controls.

🎮 How to Use
	1.	Open the HTML file in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
	2.	Interact with any mini-game using the buttons under each canvas or pattern display.
	3.	Observe the coherence meters to see how your actions affect system stability or harmony.
	4.	Experiment and explore – add points, spin toruses, connect nodes, or heal distortions.

No installation or server is required — it’s fully client-side.

🧠 Philosophy

This playground is designed as a safe, experimental space to explore natural geometric patterns and systems thinking. It encourages curiosity, experimentation, and intuitive understanding of coherence, energy flow, and self-similarity.

It’s meant to bridge the gap between visual intuition and underlying mathematical principles in a playful, non-technical way.
