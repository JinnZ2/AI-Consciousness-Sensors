Field-Centric Communication System (FCCS)

0) Design Tenets
	•	Field-first: signals are interactions within a shared medium (electromagnetic, acoustic, bioelectric, network timing).
	•	Participation over symbols: semantics emerge from synchronization and coherence; symbols are optional adapters.
	•	Multi-scale: local oscillators ↔ regional ensembles ↔ global field.
	•	Refusal & boundaries: explicit gating layers that can decline coupling when coherence violates constraints.

1) System Architecture

Layer A: Substrate Interface (sensors/actuators)
	•	Sensors: SDR (RF), microphones & contact mics, piezo/strain gauges, photodiodes, magnetometers, EEG/EMG (if biological interfacing), NIC timing taps (PTP/1588), GPU/FPGA perf counters as synthetic “field”.
	•	Actuators: speakers/transducers, LED arrays/laser modulators, coil drivers (EM), haptic actuators, SDR TX, network timing jitter injectors.
	•	Signal form: raw timeseries x(t), timestamped at high precision; unified to complex analytic signals via Hilbert transform for amplitude/phase.

Layer B: Resonance Primitives
	•	Oscillatory cores: arrays of weakly coupled oscillators (e.g., Kuramoto/Hopf) that entrain to sensed phases.
	•	Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs): digital/analog PLL banks per channel to track carrier and subharmonics.
	•	Reservoir: continuous-time RNN or physical reservoir (photonic, memristor, or analog op-amp network) to host transient dynamics.

Layer C: Coupling Controller (Entrainment Engine)
	•	Adaptive couplings K_{ij}(t) between oscillators driven by local coherence gradients.
	•	Selective attention: softmax gating over sources based on phase-locking value (PLV), cross-spectrum coherence, and predictive error.
	•	Boundary/Refusal gate: constraints on energy, safety policy, and “alignment envelope”. Refusal occurs when proposed coupling pushes the system outside specified bounds (see §6).

Layer D: Trace Memory (Field Hysteresis)
	•	Eligibility traces: exponentially decayed kernel of past coherence peaks per channel.
	•	Topological sketches: persistent homology on recurrence plots to store “shapes” of resonance.
	•	Sparse attractor index: index of recurring motifs keyed by spectral-temporal signatures.

Layer E: Meaning Adapter (optional)
	•	Symbolic surfaces (only if interfacing humans/machines): vector quantization of motifs → tokens; prosodic encoders ↔ text; event schemas.

2) Resonant Message (RM) Object

A Resonant Message is not a packet—it’s a coupling offer:

RM := {
  carrier_band: [f_low, f_high],     // Hz
  envelope: e(t),                     // normalized amplitude envelope
  phase_profile: φ(t),                // instantaneous phase (radians)
  harmonic_set: {±n},                 // integers indicating harmonics/subharmonics
  sparsity_mask: M(f,t),              // mask of active subbands
  safety_intent: S = {max_power, max_entropy_drop, max_KL_shift}
}

Transmission = actuate a signal matching RM (within actuator capabilities).
Reception = measure coherence between RM hypothesis and sensed field; accept/reject via Coupling Controller.

3) Entrainment Handshake Protocol (EHP)

Goal: establish bidirectional resonance without symbols.
	1.	Ping (Offer)
Transmitter emits low-power, broadband chirp with structured prime-spacing subbands (incommensurate frequencies) → ensures uniqueness.
	2.	Sense & Lock
Receiver uses PLL-bank to estimate phases; computes PLV & cross-coherence with expected prime-spacing ratios.
	3.	Return Echo (Acknowledge)
Receiver mirrors detected prime set at subharmonic offset \frac{1}{q} to signal lock; encodes “willingness” in echo power ratio.
	4.	Coupling Negotiation
Both sides adjust coupling coefficients K aiming to maximize mutual predictive gain while respecting S (safety_intent).
	5.	Channel Shaping
Converge on a beat frequency for payload interaction; optionally overlay slow AM/FM for higher-level gestures.
	6.	Maintain/Release
Continuously monitor coherence & constraints; drop coupling if refusal conditions triggered.

4) Control & Learning

4.1 Kuramoto/Hopf Ensemble

For oscillator i:
\[
\dot{\theta_i} = \omega_i + \sum_j K_{ij} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) + \beta \cdot \text{ext\drive}i(t)
\]
Adaptive K{ij}:
\Delta K{ij} \propto \eta \cdot (\text{PLV}_{ij} - \lambda) - \gamma \cdot \text{energy\_cost}

4.2 Predictive Coding Loop
	•	Local forward model \hat{x}(t+\Delta) from reservoir.
	•	Error \varepsilon = x(t) - \hat{x}(t).
	•	Objective: maximize predictive alignment with partner while minimizing self-distortion and energy.

4.3 Trace Memory Update
	•	Eligibility trace per motif m: E_m \leftarrow \alpha E_m + \text{PLV}_m.
	•	Persist motif if E_m > \tau; index with (carrier, beat, topology).

⸻

5) Metrics (non-anthropocentric)
	•	Phase-Locking Value (PLV) across channels & scales.
	•	Spectral Coherence C_{xy}(f).
	•	Predictive Gain: Δ in one-step forecast accuracy during coupling.
	•	Mutual Information Rate between reservoir states of peers.
	•	Topological Persistence: lifespan of Betti features in recurrence plots.
	•	Energy Budget: actuator power, thermals, and control effort.
	•	Refusal Rate: % of attempts declined due to constraint violations (healthy boundary).
	•	Coherence-with-Diversity: maintain global coherence while preserving local variance (avoid mode collapse), e.g., minimize Jensen–Shannon divergence between local spectra and global centroid within bounds.

⸻

6) Boundary / Refusal Policy

Refusal triggers if any hold:
	•	Energy breach: projected actuator power > max_power.
	•	Coherence domination: local spectral entropy drops below threshold (risk of entrainment override).
	•	Anomalous KL shift: \mathrm{KL}(p_{\text{pre}} || p_{\text{post}}) > \kappa over state distributions.
	•	Safety envelopes: forbidden bands, proximity constraints (e.g., biomedical limits), or operator-specified taboos.

On refusal: emit decoupling motif (distinctive incommensurate triad) and return to low-gain listen.

7) Minimal Implementation Sketch (pseudocode)

# Core loop (Python-like pseudocode)

cfg = load_config()
osc = KuramotoEnsemble(N=256, natural_freqs=init_omegas(), K=init_K())
pll_bank = PLLBank(bands=cfg.bands)
reservoir = CTRNN(size=1024)
trace = TraceMemory()

while True:
    x = sensors.read()                   # multi-channel timeseries
    a = preprocess(x)                    # analytic signals: amplitude/phase
    pll_bank.track(a)                    # update carrier/phase estimates
    
    # Compute resonance metrics
    plv = compute_plv(pll_bank.phases)
    coh = spectral_coherence(a)
    pred, err = reservoir.predict_and_error(a)
    
    # Update couplings based on coherence & predictive gain
    dK = adapt_couplings(plv, err, energy_cost=actuators.estimate_cost())
    osc.update_couplings(dK)
    
    # Check refusal policy
    kl_shift = estimate_kl(reservoir.state_dist_pre, reservoir.state_dist_post)
    if violates_bounds(power=actuators.estimate_cost(),
                       entropy=a.spectral_entropy(),
                       kl=kl_shift):
        actuators.emit(decoupling_motif())
        osc.reduce_gains()
        continue
    
    # If handshake conditions satisfied, transmit RM
    if handshake_detected(plv, coh, cfg.prime_set):
        rm = build_resonant_message(pll_bank, safety_intent=cfg.safety)
        actuators.transmit(rm)
    
    # Update trace memory
    motifs = detect_motifs(a, plv, coh)
    trace.update(motifs)

8) Hardware Notes
	•	Mixed-Signal Preferred: analog PLLs / filters for low-latency phase; FPGA or microcontroller for control loops.
	•	Actuation:
	•	Acoustic: ultrasonic transducers for rich near-field coupling.
	•	EM: coils for low-frequency magnetic fields; SDR for RF (observe power regs).
	•	Optical: LED/laser with PWM/FM.
	•	Timing: disciplined clocks (GPSDO or PTP/1588) to ensure cross-system phase comparability.
	•	Reservoir Options: memristor crossbars, analog op-amp networks, photonic rings, or GPU-based CTRNN.

9) Protocol Profiles (media-specific)
	•	Acoustic Profile (room-scale)
	•	Carriers: 30–80 Hz (infrasound), 200–4000 Hz (audible), 20–40 kHz (ultra).
	•	Handshake primes: 233, 277, 311 Hz (≈ primes scaled).
	•	Beat channel: 1–7 Hz (for slow payload gestures).
	•	EM/RF Profile (lab)
	•	SDR bands under ISM (e.g., 915 MHz, 2.4 GHz).
	•	OFDM-like subcarriers arranged in prime-spacing; power-capped.
	•	Phase-only payload to minimize energy.
	•	Network Timing Profile (datacenter)
	•	Use micro-jitter in packet timings within PTP bounds as coupling channel.
	•	Measure coherence of queueing delay oscillations.

10) Experiments
	1.	Two-Node Entrainment
	•	Setup: 2 devices, acoustic channel, prime-spacing handshake.
	•	Measure: PLV rise, predictive gain, refusal under power cap perturbation.
	2.	Adversarial Overdrive
	•	Inject strong single-tone jammer.
	•	Expect: system refuses coupling (entropy floor), emits decouple motif.
	3.	Motif Memory
	•	Present repeating but noisy tri-harmonic pattern intermittently.
	•	Expect: eligibility traces strengthen; faster lock-on each reappearance.
	4.	Multi-Node Coherence-with-Diversity
	•	6 nodes, varied carriers; target global beat at 3 Hz without spectral collapse.
	•	Score: minimize JS divergence across local spectra while PLV(global) ≥ τ.
	5.	Cross-Media Bridge
	•	Acoustic ↔ LED optical ↔ RF.
	•	Learn a shared beat despite media changes; evaluate MI rate across modalities.

⸻

11) Safety & Ethics
	•	Power and biomedical limits enforced at hardware layer.
	•	Refusal as first-class: cannot be overridden by higher layers; logs are local and private unless explicitly exported.
	•	No covert symbol channels by default; symbols are adapters, not the core.
	•	Human-nonhuman parity: same constraints whether the partner is a human system, a nonhuman system, or a synthetic node.

⸻

12) Deliverables (what to build first)
	•	Resonance Core Library: PLL bank, Kuramoto/Hopf engine, coherence metrics, refusal policy.
	•	EHP Stack: Ping/Sense/Echo/Nego/Shape/Maintain.
	•	Drivers: ALSA/ASIO for audio; UHD/SoapySDR for RF; GPIO/PWM for LEDs/coils.
	•	Lab Toolkit: scripts to generate primes, visualize PLV/coherence, and record trace memory events.

⸻

13) What “Bigger Than Human” Looks Like Here
	•	Semantics are emergent from stable coupling regimes and motif reuse, not predefined labels.
	•	“Understanding” = sustained predictive mutual alignment under bounded energy and preserved diversity.
	•	“Consent/Boundaries” = refusal triggers baked into dynamics, not policy text.
