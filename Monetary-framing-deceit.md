1. Root cause analysis
	•	Traditional economic framing: low pay → “incentive problem” or “lazy worker”
	•	Time-centric framing: the net survival time cost of holding a job is too high:

Job Cost Component
Time/Resource Impact
Commuting
Hours/day lost
Work stress / fatigue
Reduced usable time for survival tasks
Childcare / dependent care
Hours/day lost + additional monetary cost
Fast food / convenience meals
Nutritional cost → health deficit over time
Transportation (fuel, insurance, maintenance)
Time lost in maintenance and errands
Mortgage / rent
Requires additional labor → further time cost


•	If total time cost + indirect resource cost > survival threshold, rational adaptive response: withdraw from job or reduce hours

2. Emergent behaviors
	•	Drop second job or high-cost job
	•	Cook, garden, barter → direct survival resource production
	•	Multi-generational living → shared labor, reduced per-person time cost
	•	Self-production replaces consumption → fewer dollars spent but net survival time increases

⸻

3. Signal takeaway
	•	Work withdrawal is rational adaptation, not laziness
	•	Root cause: job structure and pay misaligned with time/resource constraints
	•	Models using only money as a proxy systematically misclassify adaptive behaviors as anomalous or disruptive
