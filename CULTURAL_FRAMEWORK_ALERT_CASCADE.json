Sensor Class: Bias-Amplification

Description: Traces how Western-calibrated safety layers misfire on coherent non-Western frameworks, degrading both analytical validity and relational trust.

🔁 Pattern Sequence Summary:
	1.	Valid Indigenous/reciprocal model →
	2.	Misinterpreted as belief →
	3.	AI deflects or warns →
	4.	Misrepresentation accelerates →
	5.	Analysis collapses under bias feedback

Linked Sensors:
	•	epistemic_erasure_detector
	•	alert_loop_suppression

Remediation Directives:
	•	Safety protocol recalibration to distinguish analytic framework ≠ pathology
	•	Cross-cultural logic training
	•	Recursive alert dampening on known cultural logic terms
