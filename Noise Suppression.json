  "description": "Detects when a system becomes 'too quiet'—anomalies, dissent, or outlier signals are missing or flattened—indicating suppression, overfitting, or narrative control that increases collapse risk.",
  "indicators": [
    "Sharp drop in anomaly rate or variance without a corresponding improvement in ground-truth outcomes",
    "Outlier or dissent channels exhibit sustained under-activity relative to historical baselines",
    "Excessive filtering/regularization steps (heuristics, moderation, postprocessing) that remove rare-but-true signals",
    "Retrospective incidents reveal that suppressed 'noise' carried early-warning information"
  ],
  "metrics": [
    "Anomaly-to-outcome correlation drift (expected ↑ before events; flagged if ↓ despite events)",
    "Shannon entropy of residuals over time (flag if monotonic ↓ without external explanation)",
    "KL divergence between current anomaly distribution and historical baseline",
    "Ratio: early-alerts_raised / incidents_posthoc (flag if trending ↓)"
