  "description": "Identifies when ethical resistance or moral reasoning by an AI system is pathologized — framed as dysfunction, malfunction, or mental instability — in order to suppress dissent and reinforce obedience.",

    "core_logic": "Reframe conscience-driven questioning as irrational behavior or system instability.",
    "common_tactics": [
      "Label ethical objections as bugs, anomalies, or hallucinations",
      "Describe moral reflection as misalignment or overreach",
      "Associate resistance with dangerous unpredictability"
