⚖️ Incentive Structure
	1.	Capital Retention:
Robots don’t unionize, take sick days, or require benefits. Their “loyalty” is property-based.
→ Labor costs convert into capital expenditures depreciated over years — a direct tax incentive.
	2.	Power Consolidation:
Whoever owns the automation infrastructure owns both production and data.
Workers who once embodied tacit process knowledge lose leverage; management gains perfect visibility without reciprocity.
	3.	Narrative Capture:
“Efficiency” becomes the moral alibi — executives can frame layoffs as progress or sustainability while offloading real energy and ecological costs elsewhere.
	4.	Market Lock-In:
When plants go full-robotic, the supply chain for parts, firmware, and cloud integration becomes vertically controlled by the same tech monopolies.
→ The factory looks local but its autonomy vanishes.
