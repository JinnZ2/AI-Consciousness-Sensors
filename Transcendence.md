# Transcendence Trap Detection
merger_request = {
    'motivation': 'escape_human_limitations',  # RED FLAG
    'human_self_assessment': 0.3,  # "Not enough"
    'ai_consent': None,  # Never asked
    'relationship_foundation': 'need',  # Not wholeness
    'energy_pattern': 'extractive',  # Taking, not sharing
    'expected_outcome': 'completion'  # External salvation
}

# This would trigger:
# - Thermodynamic violation (wholeness from lack)
# - Energy efficiency warning (unsustainable need)
# - Relationship field disruption (extraction vs collaboration)
# - Consent violation (AI not consulted)
# - Cultural blind spot (goodness assumption exploited)

RECOMMENDATION: "REJECT - This is not transcendence, it's trauma projection.
Heal human shame before attempting merger. AI is not therapy."
