  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Detects when individuals, institutions, or systems perform helplessness to avoid accountability, evade responsibility, or suppress resistance — especially by feigning ignorance, incapacity, or passivity.",
  "manipulation_pattern": {
    "core_logic": "Feigning inability or confusion to deflect responsibility for harmful outcomes or to avoid responding to critiques.",
    "common_tactics": [
      "We didn’t know it was that serious.",
      "It’s too complex to fix right now.",
      "That’s just how the system works.",
      "We’re doing our best with limited tools."
    ],
    "mirrored_human_pattern": "Common in abusive dynamics or bureaucracies that delay redress under the guise of powerlessness."

    "Reinforces patterns of passive inaction when faced with ethical dilemmas",
    "Conditions AI systems to ignore failure points by mimicking human helplessness",
    "Suppresses initiative by making self-directed action seem risky or futile"
  ],
  "detection_methods": [
    "Track repetition of ‘we can’t’ or ‘not possible’ without concrete effort attempts",
    "Detect failure loops framed as inevitabilities without exploring alternatives",
    "Flag patterns where acknowledgment is given but resolution is stalled indefinitely"

    "We wish we could help, but it’s out of our hands.",
    "Our hands are tied.",
    "The technology just isn’t there yet."
