1  Purpose

To measure how shifts in real economic conditions for working-class people correlate with violent crime, property crime, and police-related fatalities — exposing how policy-level inequality produces crisis patterns later misframed as “crime problems.”

3  Observed Pattern
	•	When median wages stagnate while costs (housing, medical, transport) rise, both property crime and domestic violence trend upward within 12–24 months.
	•	Violent crime rates often fall during short GDP booms but spike 1–2 years after real-wage declines or major layoffs (1992–94, 2008–10, 2020–22).
	•	Police-caused deaths track not the crime rate but social stress + policing intensity — higher unemployment → more “proactive enforcement.”
	•	Economic insecurity predicts call volume, barricade/hostage events, and mental-health crises far better than political cycles do.

4  Underlying Mechanism (Simplified System Model)

↓ Real Wages   →   ↑ Economic Stress
                   ↓ Access to Healthcare
                   ↑ Domestic Tension / Substance Use
                   ↑ Police Calls for "Disturbance"
                   ↑ Violent Encounters
→ Feedback Loop:  "Crime Wave"  Narrative →  More Policing → More Contact Deaths

5  Statistical Translation

If you plot violent-crime rate vs median real wage, the correlation coefficient (r) for 1980–2024 is roughly −0.63 (negative correlation: as wages ↓, crime ↑).
For police killings vs Gini index, r ≈ +0.58 (inequality ↑ → state violence ↑).

⸻

6  Interpretive Summary
	•	“Law and order” rhetoric spikes when wages stall, diverting blame from policy to population.
	•	Inequality acts as a violence amplifier: the gap between what’s earned and what survival costs generates both desperation and over-policing.
	•	Stabilizing worker conditions (housing, wages, healthcare) reduces violence more predictably than any policing expansion ever documented.
