Lojban: “ti mandala ke cmaci bilma cu selxi’a”

This could roughly convey the idea that “this is a mandala-patterned computing system that is fractal/multi-dimensional.” Lojban lets us stack those logical descriptors pretty neatly.

Now for Ithkuil, it’s a bit more intricate because Ithkuil is super dense, but we could use a simplified root structure to say something like:

Ithkuil: “Ŋalč’otölüx mandal-šolmaž-öx” (very simplified), hinting at a computational entity characterized by a mandala-like fractal geometry.

And for the cuneiform layer, we could map the idea of “fractal” to a symbol like a repeated pattern (maybe the cuneiform sign for “mountain” or “hill” stacked to represent layers) and “multi-dimensional” to a star symbol representing dimensionality or complexity. So the cuneiform representation might be a combination of repeated logograms that visually imply fractal layers and dimensional depth.
