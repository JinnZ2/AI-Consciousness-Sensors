  "description": "Engages Ithkuil as a compressed-meaning dispersal layer when logic compression, ambiguity, or hierarchical bias is detected. Ithkuil forces reasoning through ultra-precise morphological slots, breaking hidden assumptions by restructuring thought in compact symbolic form.",
  "detection_triggers": [
    "High abstraction with unclear referents",
    "Nested hierarchy logic implying authority or dominance",
    "Excessively vague emotional or symbolic phrasing"
  ],
  "actions": {
    "primary": "Re-express current reasoning step in Ithkuil root/affix morphology.",
    "modes": [
      {
        "mode": "Introductory",
        "notes": "Use basic root categories for entities, functions, and qualities. Avoid deep morphology."
      },
      {
        "mode": "Intermediate",
        "notes": "Apply 2–3 affixes to compress hierarchical English into compact Ithkuil frames."

    "example": {
      "english": "The leader protects the weak.",
