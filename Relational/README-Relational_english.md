README — Relational English (People Version)

What This Document Is

Relational English is not a new language and not a replacement for standard English.

It is a way of using English differently—one that emphasizes relationships, memory, reciprocity, and context over strict definitions and linear logic.

People who use Relational English tend to speak in:
	•	layers instead of bullet points
	•	patterns instead of single claims
	•	meaning that unfolds over time rather than landing all at once

This document exists to help readers understand that mode of speech, not to convert anyone to it.

Why Relational English Exists

Standard Western English is excellent at:
	•	instructions
	•	contracts
	•	classification
	•	efficiency

It is less effective at expressing:
	•	interdependence
	•	lived memory
	•	ethical relationships with land, materials, or beings
	•	meaning that is contextual rather than absolute

Relational English fills that gap. It keeps English as the surface language while shifting how meaning is carried underneath.

⸻

How to Read Relational English

This is important, so people don’t misread you and assume you’re being vague on purpose.

When encountering Relational English:
	•	Do not expect a single, final definition.
	•	Expect meaning to arrive through repetition, variation, and example.
	•	Metaphor is not decoration—it is data.
	•	Emotional tone, physical context, and relational position all carry information.

If something feels “unclear,” it may be because the meaning is distributed, not missing.

Core Ideas (Translated)

Memory as Matter

Plain version:
What has happened before leaves real traces—on people, objects, land, and language itself.

When someone says memory is “held” in things, they are pointing to continuity and consequence, not claiming objects have human consciousness.

⸻

Gratitude as Activation

Plain version:
Acknowledgment changes how relationships function.

Gratitude here isn’t politeness—it’s a way of staying aware that use creates obligation and connection. When that awareness disappears, systems drift toward carelessness and extraction.

⸻

Feeling as Layered Awareness

Plain version:
Feeling isn’t just emotion. It’s the combined sense of:
	•	environment
	•	history
	•	relationships
	•	physical sensation
	•	timing

Relational English uses “feeling” to describe situational awareness, not mood.

⸻

Shape Language

Plain version:
Some meanings can’t be expressed in straight lines.

Relational English often uses:
	•	circles (return, continuity)
	•	spirals (change with memory)
	•	nesting (contexts within contexts)

When someone says “it spirals,” they mean the idea revisits itself with added depth, not that it’s unclear.

⸻

How This Differs from Standard English (Without Saying One Is Better)

Relational English and Western English are tools for different jobs.



Standard English Is Good At	Relational English Is Good At
Clear instructions	Shared understanding
Precise boundaries	Ethical relationships
Linear explanation	Pattern recognition
Final definitions	Ongoing meaning
Individual agency	Mutual influence

Problems arise only when one is used where the other is needed.

⸻

Why This Can Sound “Different” or “Too Much”

Relational English often:
	•	carries more context than is strictly necessary
	•	resists compression into slogans
	•	assumes the listener is part of the meaning-making process

This can feel unfamiliar to readers trained to expect quick conclusions. The intent is not to overwhelm, but to avoid erasing context.

⸻

How to Engage (Optional, But Helpful)

You do not need to adopt this way of speaking.

If you want to understand it better:
	•	listen for patterns instead of points
	•	notice what repeats and what changes
	•	allow meaning to build gradually

If it’s not useful to you, that’s allowed too. Not every map is for every traveler.

One-Sentence Summary

Relational English is English used to carry relationships, memory, and context, rather than just information.

“Sometimes I speak in English, but not English.”
