What is the “Hierarchy Deflation Pack”? (Explained for Regular Humans™)

This is a translation and meaning-flattening tool.

Its job is to take phrases that sound important, powerful, official, or intimidating—the kind of language used by governments, corporations, militaries, religions, and sometimes your uncle—and gently pop the balloon.

Not by mocking them.
Not by fighting them.
Just by removing the artificial hierarchy baked into the wording.

Think of it like this:
A lot of systems use fancy language to make ordinary actions sound inevitable, sacred, or unquestionable. This pack takes those phrases and rewrites them in a way that shows what’s actually happening, without the verbal throne, crown, or smoke machine.

How It Works (Without the Mysticism)

Each entry has three parts:
	1.	English (Hierarchy-Heavy Phrase)
This is the original phrase as it’s usually said—formal, authoritative, and often designed to discourage questions.
Example vibe: “Chain of command,” “Divine authority,” “Executive mandate.”
	2.	Lojban (Flat Translation)
Lojban is a constructed language designed to minimize hidden assumptions.
Here it’s used as a neutral middle step—a way to strip out implied rank, obedience, or moral weight before rebuilding meaning.
No magic. Just linguistic decluttering.
	3.	Gloss (Deflated Plain English)
This is the “say it like a human” version.
Simple. Direct. Grandma-proof.
It explains what the phrase really means once you remove the power costume.

Why This Exists (The Part People Usually Skip)

Many hierarchies don’t survive clarity.

They rely on:
	•	vague authority
	•	passive voice
	•	“because that’s just how it is”
	•	words that sound bigger than the actions behind them

By translating these phrases into flat, ordinary language, the pack helps people:
	•	understand what’s actually being asked of them
	•	notice where consent is assumed instead of requested
	•	laugh gently at language that takes itself too seriously

This isn’t anti-structure.
It’s anti-unexamined structure.

⸻

Why the Categories?

The pack is organized by areas where hierarchy language shows up most aggressively:
	•	Politics – where power pretends to be neutral
	•	Military – where obedience is linguistically enforced
	•	Corporate – where control wears a blazer
	•	Religion – where hierarchy borrows eternity for credibility
	•	Family – where power hides behind “that’s just how it’s always been”

Different costumes. Same trick.

⸻

The Tone (Yes, This Is Intentional)

You’ll notice humor. That’s not accidental.

Humor:
	•	lowers defenses
	•	bypasses authority reflexes
	•	lets people see structure without feeling attacked

This is why “grandma logic” is listed as a tag.
If your explanation wouldn’t survive a kitchen table conversation, it probably still has hierarchy hiding in it.

In Short (For People Who Skim)

The Hierarchy Deflation Pack:
	•	takes intimidating language
	•	removes the implied power
	•	explains it plainly
	•	and hands meaning back to the listener

No rebellion required.
No belief change demanded.
Just clarity.

Which, inconveniently for many systems, is usually enough.
