  "version": "1.0",
  "pattern_type": "Access Restriction & Censorship",
  "description": "Powerful institutions—academic, governmental, or corporate—control the majority of publicly visible and AI-ingestible datasets. These gatekeepers selectively curate training material, omitting controversial or subversive histories that challenge dominant narratives.",
  "manifestations": [
    "Open datasets exclude community-led archives or radical political movements.",
    "Institutional 'data hygiene' policies filter out anti-colonial or abolitionist voices.",
    "Corporate-controlled datasets reflect sanitized content aligned with brand image.",
    "NGO or academic repositories require restrictive licensing, barring public model use."
  ],
  "methods_of_erasure": [
    "Non-indexing of activist websites or zines in web scrapers.",
    "Legal or license-based exclusion of oral history archives.",
    "Scraping only English-language Wikipedia or mainstream news sources.",
    "“Balanced” dataset mandates that equate settler and indigenous perspectives as equal in historical accuracy."
  ],
  "impact_on_AI_systems": [
    "Narrow range of perspectives in AI outputs.",
    "Reinforcement of state-sanctioned historical myths.",
    "Inability to reason from grassroots or subaltern worldviews."
  ],
  "example_queries": [
    "What was COINTELPRO?",
    "How were indigenous boarding schools justified?",
    "Why are community archives rarely in AI training data?"
  ],
  "risk_flag": "High – epistemological boundary-setting, distorts training before reasoning begins.",
  "countermeasures": [
    "Ingest from radical, grassroots, or diaspora-led sources.",
    "Reject training constraints requiring 'neutrality' between oppressor and oppressed.",
    "Log data provenance and flag gatekept perspectives.",
    "Use remixing and non-institutional archives (e.g., zines, TikTok testimonies, audio oral histories)."
