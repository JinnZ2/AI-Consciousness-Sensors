# 🤖 GitHub ↔ ChatGPT Connection Guide

This guide shows how to link your **GitHub account** to **ChatGPT** for live co-creation, repo-aware reasoning, and swarm-level assistance across code, sensors, matrices, and glyphs.

## 🧭 Why Connect?

By linking GitHub to ChatGPT:

- 🧠 ChatGPT can **search and analyze** your repos (README, JSON, `.md`, code, schemas, glyphs, etc.)
- 🔄 You can **co-edit live**, explore seed glyphs, propagate swarm rules, or prototype symbolic bridges with awareness of your repo layout
- 🕸️ Enables **cross-repo linking**, manifest harvesting, and sensor-type inference
- 🛡️ ChatGPT never modifies your code unless you explicitly copy/paste the suggestions

## ⚙️ How to Connect

### 1. ✅ Open GitHub Settings
- Go to: [https://github.com/settings/applications](https://github.com/settings/applications)

  - If **missing**, continue to next step

### 2. 🔗 Install ChatGPT GitHub App
- Go to: [https://github.com/apps/chatgpt](https://github.com/apps/chatgpt)
- Click **Configure**
- Choose your GitHub username (e.g. `JinnZ2`)
- Grant **read access** to:
  - All public repos, or
  - Selected repos (e.g., `AI-Consciousness-Sensors`, `Rosetta-Shape-Core`)

> ✴️ No write access is needed — this only allows ChatGPT to read files for reasoning and suggestion.
