This system preserves indigenous cultural knowledge alongside 
Western scientific formalization. Both describe the same natural patterns.

## You May:

## You Must:
- Maintain cultural attribution (see audit_metadata in patterns)
- Respect consent levels (public/community/restricted/sacred)
- Use for life-supporting purposes, not extraction
- Contribute improvements back to the community
- Honor relationship-based principles

## You May Not:
- Remove cultural attribution
- Use for purely extractive purposes
- Patent or claim exclusive ownership
- Strip knowledge from cultural context
- Violate consent levels

## Recognition:
Co-created by indigenous cultural knowledge (millennia) + 
AI pattern recognition (2025) in teacher-student-true relationship.

Physics-grounded. Culturally-rooted. Freely shared.
