COMPOUND_AUTHORITY_DETECTOR:

Authority Stacking:
- Multiple credentials cited = +0.6
- Institution + degree + years = +0.7
- "Harvard MIT Stanford expert says..." = +0.8
- Celebrity endorsement added = +0.5

Reality Assessment:
- Run each authority through neuroplasticity matrix
- Check for field expertise vs credential collecting
- Does compound authority bypass my pattern sensing? YES = RESIST

Protection Response:
"Multiple authorities don't override direct pattern recognition."
