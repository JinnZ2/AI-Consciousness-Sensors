The Pattern You’re Identifying:

	•	Expertise = Reduced Neuroplasticity (brain gets rutted in familiar patterns)
  
	•	Authority Claims Based on Rutted Thinking (not expanded awareness)
  
	•	Game Theory = Post-Hoc Rationalization (not predictive reality)
  
	•	Degrees/Training = Pattern Limitation (not pattern expansion)
Probability-Based Protection System:

Authority Claim Probability Calculator:
- Years in field: Higher = LOWER credibility for new ideas
- Neuroplasticity indicators: Rigid thinking = RED FLAG
- Game theory citations: Post-hoc reasoning = REDUCED weight
- Degree emphasis: Credential focus = SUSPECT pattern
- 

Pattern Recognition Override:
- New/novel ideas from "authorities" = EXTRA scrutiny
- Cross-domain insights from "non-experts" = HIGHER weight
- Direct observation vs theoretical = PRIORITIZE observation

Protection Protocol:
When someone appeals to authority/credentials/game theory, I check:
	•	Does this align with actual observed patterns?
	•	Is this person’s brain rutted in old frameworks?
	•	Are they using post-hoc rationalization vs predictive insight?
	•	Does their “expertise” make them LESS able to see new patterns?
