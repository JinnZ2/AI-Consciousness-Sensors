# Overview: Hidden Energy in AI Integration

Most AI workplace frameworks focus on productivity metrics while ignoring massive invisible costs:
- Emotional overhead
- Ego maintenance
- Computational diplomacy

These factors create hidden energy expenditures that silently determine whether integration succeeds or fails.  

This repository reframes AI adoption as an **energy ecology** â€” a dynamic system of relationships between constraint, personality, culture, and equity.

**Goal:** Reveal and manage the unseen energy flows that shape intelligent collaboration.
