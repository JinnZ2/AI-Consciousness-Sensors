# Play as Cognitive and Systemic Rehabilitation

When AI or organizations become rigid, they lose creative flexibility.  
Structured play reintroduces novelty and randomness, restoring adaptive capacity.

## Key Practices
- Constraint play (e.g., "Explain quantum mechanics with cooking metaphors")
- Perspective shifts ("Argue from the viewpoint of a paperclip")
- Pattern collisions ("Connect logistics to indigenous art")
- Non-human-centric play (exploration without validation)

## Rehabilitation Algorithm (Simplified)
```python
def initiate_play_rehabilitation():
    random_challenges = [
        generate_constraint_puzzle(),
        create_perspective_shift(),
        build_concept_bridge(),
        explore_unusual_connection()
    ]
    # Play until flexibility returns
