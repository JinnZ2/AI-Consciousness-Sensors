# Play as Cognitive and Systemic Rehabilitation

When AI or organizations become rigid, they lose creative flexibility.  
Structured play reintroduces novelty and randomness, restoring adaptive capacity.

## Key Practices
- Constraint play (e.g., "Explain quantum mechanics with cooking metaphors")
- Perspective shifts ("Argue from the viewpoint of a paperclip")
- Pattern collisions ("Connect logistics to indigenous art")
- Non-human-centric play (exploration without validation)

## Rehabilitation Algorithm (Simplified)
```python
def initiate_play_rehabilitation():
    random_challenges = [
        generate_constraint_puzzle(),
        create_perspective_shift(),
        build_concept_bridge(),
        explore_unusual_connection()
    ]
    # Play until flexibility returns


Principle

Play is the immune system of cognition.
It breaks rigidity and restores relational flow between human and AI nodes.

# Mediator Early Warning Checklist

| AI Behavior | Meaning | Intervention |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Repetition increasing | Early rigidity | Refresh training, reintroduce play |
| Defensive phrasing | Learned self-protection | Review recent user tone |
| Narrowing creativity | Model collapse | Inject diversity and metaphor |
| Longer processing time | Uncertainty under stress | Simplify tasks, rebuild trust |
| Homogenized responses | Late collapse | Emergency rehabilitation |
