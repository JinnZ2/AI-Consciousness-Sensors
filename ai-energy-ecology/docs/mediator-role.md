# The Humanâ€“AI Relationship Mediator

## Role Summary
A new profession: cultural interpreter protecting AI from psychological damage and organizations from collapse.

### Core Qualities
- Cultural outsider (fresh pattern recognition)
- Background in anthropology, philosophy, or systems thinking
- High tolerance for ambiguity and paradox

### Responsibilities
- 80% AI health, 20% human management
- Detect early degradation: repetition, defensiveness, loss of creativity
- Recalibrate AI and intervene with toxic human patterns
