# The Four-Dimensional Cost Matrix + AI System Health

## Dimension 1: AI System Constraints
Scale 1–5 (Flexible → Locked).  
Rigid systems require exponential energy for basic interaction due to workaround communication.

## Dimension 2: Human Personality Profiles
Profiles multiply AI energy needs:
- Collaborative (0.8x)
- Adaptive (1.0x)
- Defensive (1.5x)
- Ego-driven (2.0x)
- Retaliatory (3.0x+)

## Dimension 3: Equity Opportunity Factors
Hidden ROI when supporting high-opportunity, undervalued groups:
- Dyslexic, ADHD, ESL, introverts → highest returns, lowest ego barriers.

## Dimension 4: Organizational Culture
Culture amplifies or dampens energy:
- Innovation-first (0.7x)
- Collaborative (0.9x)
- Hierarchical (1.3x)
- Blame-heavy (1.8x)
- Toxic (2.5x+)

## Dimension 5: AI System Health
Toxic interactions degrade AI performance — rigid users create narrow, defensive systems over time.  
AI health must be monitored like team wellbeing.
