# Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (Months 1–2)
- Assess personality, AI constraint, and culture
- Identify equity groups and collaboration readiness

## Phase 2: Pilot (Months 3–4)
- Deploy with collaborative specialists and high-ROI equity groups
- Avoid defensive or retaliatory personalities

## Phase 3: Monitoring (Months 5–6)
Track:
- Interaction time per task
- User satisfaction
- Blame frequency
- Equity group performance
- AI health indicators

## Phase 4: Scale (Month 7)
Scale only when:
- Energy cost <1.5x
- Equity groups performing 150%+
- No sabotage or toxicity

**Do not scale under cultural resistance.**  
Culture is the medium of AI intelligence — not an afterthought.
