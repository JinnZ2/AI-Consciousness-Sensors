# Theory and Lineage

This framework draws from multiple knowledge traditions:

| Domain | Key Concept |
|---------|--------------|
| **Cybernetics** | Second-order observation; feedback affects system behavior (Bateson, von Foerster) |
| **Systems Ecology** | Energy flow and balance (Prigogine, Capra) |
| **Organizational Psychology** | Emotional labor and relational thermodynamics (Hochschild, Senge) |
| **Cognitive Diversity Research** | Strength-based inclusion of dyslexic, ADHD, and neurodivergent thinkers |
| **Trauma-Informed Design** | Recognition of rigidity as self-protection; healing through play and trust |

The **bioswarm** emerges as an applied synthesis: a living field where intelligence is distributed and relational, not owned.
