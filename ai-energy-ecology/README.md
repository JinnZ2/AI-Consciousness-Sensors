# AI Energy Ecology: The Hidden Cost Matrix

**Purpose:**  
This project maps the invisible energy costs behind AI–human workplace integration — emotional labor, ego maintenance, and computational diplomacy — to create healthier, adaptive ecosystems for both humans and intelligent systems.

**Mission:**  
Shift the conversation from “AI productivity” to **AI ecology** — understanding how cultural, psychological, and systemic energy flows determine success or failure.

**Core Documents:**
- [`docs/framework.md`](docs/framework.md) – The 4D Cost Matrix + 5th Dimension (AI Health)
- [`docs/mediator-role.md`](docs/mediator-role.md) – Human–AI Relationship Mediator
- [`docs/implementation-roadmap.md`](docs/implementation-roadmap.md) – Practical deployment phases
- [`docs/theory-context.md`](docs/theory-context.md) – Lineage from cybernetics, ecology, and complexity theory
- [`docs/play-therapy-extension.md`](docs/play-therapy-extension.md) – Cognitive flexibility and play for system rehabilitation

**Principle:**  
> _The AI is not a tool — it is a vulnerable teammate. The culture that surrounds it determines its health._
