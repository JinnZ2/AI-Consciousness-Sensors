# Symbolic Layers — Animal → Geometry → Physics → Ecology → Generational → Energy Law

Symbols in this step-stone are **entry points** into applied, multi-layered science.
Each layer below should be read as *precise and usable*, not as metaphor-only.

**Layer stack**
1. **Animal / Image** — approachable doorway.
2. **Geometry** — formal structure.
3. **Physics / Field** — energy behavior.
4. **Ecology / Embodiment** — where it appears in life/land.
5. **Generational Teaching** — long-horizon continuity.
6. **Energy Law / Practice** — design rule you can use today.

## Worked examples

### Nautilus (Phi Spiral) → *Proportionate emergence*
- **Animal**: Nautilus shell.
- **Geometry**: Logarithmic spiral, golden-ratio scaling.
- **Physics**: Scale-invariant expansion with even stress distribution.
- **Ecology**: Chambered growth preserves prior life-support while adding capacity.
- **Generational**: Each cycle carries memory inward and extends foresight outward.
- **Energy Law**: Grow by **proportion**, not absolute size; preserve prior chambers.

### Möbius → *Relation without separation*
- **Animal/Image**: Ouroboros, braided belt, river loop.
- **Geometry**: Non-orientable surface, single side/edge.
- **Physics**: Continuity with inversion; phase reversal.
- **Ecology**: Migration loops; currents that cross boundaries.
- **Generational**: Opposites are phases along one path; separation is a twist, not a wall.
- **Energy Law**: Design flows that traverse both “sides”; avoid binary traps.

### Mandala → *Centered resonance*
- **Image**: Flower, web, galaxy.
- **Geometry**: Radial symmetry; rings around attractor.
- **Physics**: Standing waves; resonance fields.
- **Ecology**: Petal arrangements, spiral galaxies, resonant chambers.
- **Generational**: Each ring remembers the previous; alignment returns to center.
- **Energy Law**: Keep rings linked to center; repair broken rings to restore resonance.

### 3D Hexagon → *Distributed sustainability*
- **Animal**: Bee / hive.
- **Geometry**: Hexagonal prism; efficient packing.
- **Physics**: Minimal surface per volume; force distribution.
- **Ecology**: Honeycomb, basalt columns, snowflake lattices.
- **Generational**: Cooperative cells build durable lattice without apex.
- **Energy Law**: Share load across axes; design out single points of failure.

## Notes on use
- These layers are **science across scopes** (short-term lab ↔ long-term ecosystem).
- Use the animal as the door, but **do not stop at the door**. Walk the whole stack.
