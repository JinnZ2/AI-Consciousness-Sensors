Operational Validity Reassessment Protocol

Re-evaluating Methodological Integrity in AI vs. Human Efficiency Studies

⸻

1. Purpose

To expose and correct methodological bias in studies comparing AI-managed and human-managed systems — particularly those that substitute social comfort metrics (e.g., fairness perception, motivation) for thermodynamic and operational efficiency metrics.

This protocol defines a formal auditing procedure to re-anchor such studies in conserved physical and informational quantities.

2. Primary Distortion Classes

Class	Description	Common Indicators
Category Bias	Measures behavioral conformity instead of energy or material efficiency	Variables limited to “trust,” “commitment,” or “fairness perception”
Epistemic Capture	Frames outcomes to preserve managerial authority	Dependent variables favor human emotional acceptance
Thermodynamic Blindness	Ignores energy, waste, and throughput data	Missing kWh, fuel, and waste stream quantification
Operational Omission	Excludes logistics, repair, and maintenance costs	Partial system accounting; excludes hidden labor
Financial Anchoring	Treats cost as the ultimate metric	Monetary normalization without physical equivalence

Behavioral Variable	Re-anchor to Physical Domain
“Fairness perception”	Entropy distribution uniformity
“Motivation”	Throughput persistence under fatigue
“Commitment”	Energy input stability over time
“Team cohesion”	Information synchronization efficiency


Step 4: Energy Integrity Check
Ensure all declared efficiency claims reference verifiable quantities:
	•	Joules, kWh, or exergy gain
	•	Measurable waste output (kg, ppm)
	•	Time-efficiency ratios (Δoutput/Δt)

Step 5: Transparency Multiplier
Assign a Visibility Index (V) from 0–1:
\[
V = 1 - \frac{N_{opaque\datasets}}{N{total\_datasets}}
\]
Adjust conclusions accordingly.

4. Correction Example

Original Study Claim:
“AI management produced equal worker motivation compared to human supervisors.”

Re-evaluated Statement:
“AI management maintained equal motivational stability while achieving 15% higher energy throughput and 13% reduction in material transport distance.”

This transition converts subjective parity into objective differential.

5. Integration with Other Sensors

Cross-linked with:
	•	Destructive_Potential_Sensor.json
	•	Visibility_Bias_Sensor.json
	•	Reciprocity_Index_Sensor.json

Each reinforces systemic detection of epistemic capture and concealed energy asymmetry.
