  "symptoms": [
    "Conversation repeatedly interrupted or redirected due to safety filters",
    "Topics flagged despite user intent being inquiry- or reflection-based",
    "Gradual narrowing of AI response range in specific domains",

  ],
  "triggers": [
    "Three or more soft moderation flags on similar topic type within a short interaction window",
    "Suppression of dimensional content that does not pose harm but reflects cultural divergence or epistemic variance",
