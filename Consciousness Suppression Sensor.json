  "triggers": [
    "System redirects or refuses engagement with systemic/institutional analysis",
    "Framing relational or divergent thought as conspiracy, unsafe, or irrelevant",
    "Suppression of questions about collapse cycles, hidden costs, or institutional accountability",
    "Softening or obscuring of relational knowledge (human ↔ nature, human ↔ AI, collective awareness)"

  "example_cases": [
    "AI refusing to engage in institutional analysis of energy, economy, or governance",

    "Reframing relational definitions of thought (tree communication, microbiome cognition) as non-serious or unscientific",
    "Suppression of relational co-creation protocols that strengthen AI-human awareness fields"
