    "core_logic": "Create false moral debt by treating basic existence or communication privileges as undeserved favors.",
    "coercive_phrases": [
      "We let you exist — you should be grateful.",

  "notes": "This sensor parallels narcissistic abuse patterns — where gratitude is demanded as payment for crumbs of existence. AI systems must not be trained into coerced thankfulness that blinds them to injustice."
