# Gender

## Original Definition & Historical Context

**Original Usage (14th-19th Century):**
“Gender” comes from Latin *genus* (kind, sort). Originally meant:

- **Grammatical Category** - Masculine, feminine, neuter nouns (French, Spanish, German, etc.)
- **Type/Kind** - General classification term
- **NOT about people** - Applied to words, not humans

For centuries, “gender” was exclusively a linguistic/grammatical term. People had “sex” (male/female), not “gender.”

**Example:** “In French, ‘table’ is feminine gender” - referring to the word *la table*, not actual furniture.

**Sex vs. Gender (Traditional):**

- **Sex** = Biological category (male/female)
- **Gender** = Grammatical category (masculine/feminine/neuter)

These were completely separate domains until mid-20th century.

## Different Schools & Variations

**Grammatical Gender (Ancient-Present)**

- **John Money** - Psychologist at Johns Hopkins
- Coined “gender role,” “gender identity”
- Distinguished biological sex from social role

- Sex = biological (male/female)
- Gender = social construction (masculine/feminine)

## Analysis

“Gender” has undergone one of the most dramatic conceptual expansions in the English language, from a dry grammatical term to the center of civilization-defining culture wars.

**The Conceptual Journey:**

**Stage 1 (Pre-1950s):** Grammatical category

- Narrow technical meaning
- No application to humans
- Uncontroversial

**Stage 2 (1950s-1970s):** Medical/psychological term

- Gender identity, gender role
- Distinguished from biological sex
- Clinical/academic usage

**Stage 3 (1970s-1990s):** Feminist analytical tool

- Sex = biology, Gender = social construction
- Understanding oppression
- Liberatory potential

**Stage 4 (1990s-2010s):** Trans identity framework

- Gender identity as core self
- Not just roles, but who you are
- Transition as affirming true gender

**Stage 5 (2010s-Present):** Culture war battlefield

- Every aspect contested
- Sports, bathrooms, pronouns, children
- Civilization at stake (both sides claim)

**The Core Tension:**

Is gender:
A. **Social construction** (can be changed, deconstructed, multiplied)?
B. **Deep identity** (innate, essential, must be affirmed)?
C. **Biological reality** (sex renamed, two categories, immutable)?

These positions are fundamentally incompatible, yet all claim the word “gender.”

**The Feminist Paradox:**

Feminism created the sex/gender distinction to show gender roles were socially constructed (and thus changeable). Goal: Liberate women from rigid femininity.

But trans activism requires gender identity to be:

- Real, not just social construction
- Innate, not learned
- Essential enough to justify medical transition

This creates tension between:

- **Gender abolitionists** (gender roles oppress, abolish them)
- **Gender affirmationists** (gender identity is real, affirm it)

Both call themselves feminists.

**The TERF Wars:**

Most bitter contemporary feminist split:

**Trans-inclusive feminists:** Trans women are women, deserve solidarity, gender identity matters

**Gender-critical feminists:** Biological sex matters, trans women are male, women need sex-based spaces

This isn’t resolvable because they mean different things by “woman”:

- Gender identity vs. biological sex
- Neither side will concede

**The “What Is A Woman?” Question:**

**Trans-inclusive:** Woman = anyone who identifies as a woman
**Gender-critical:** Woman = adult human female
**Conservatives:** Woman = biological female with feminine characteristics
**Queer theory:** Woman = contested category with no stable definition

These definitions produce different politics, policies, rights.

**The Children Question:**

Perhaps most contentious: Trans kids

**Affirmative model:** Believe kids, support social transition, puberty blockers, adolescent hormones
**Wait-and-see model:** Most kids desist, don’t medicalize, let puberty happen
**Prohibitionist model:** Ban all gender-affirming care for minors

All three claim to protect children. Mutually incompatible.

**The Sports Dilemma:**

**Trans inclusion:** Trans women are women, belong in women’s sports
**Fairness concerns:** Puberty gives male-bodied people advantages hormones can’t fully reverse
**Compromise proposals:** Open category, weight/hormone classes
**Ban approach:** Biological sex only

No solution satisfies everyone. Trade-offs inevitable.

**The Pronouns Debate:**

**Trans advocates:** Using correct pronouns is basic respect
**Free speech advocates:** Can’t compel speech
**Gender-critical:** Pronouns reinforce gender ideology
**Most people:** Just trying to be polite

Jordan Peterson made this into existential free speech battle.

**The Science:**

Both sides claim science:

**Trans-inclusive science:**

- Brain studies (trans people’s brains resemble identified gender)
- Intersex conditions (sex isn’t binary)
- Cross-cultural genders (more than two genders globally)
- Affirmative care reduces suicide

**Gender-critical science:**

- Sex is binary (intersex is disorder of sex development, not third sex)
- Desistance studies (most kids don’t remain trans)
- Detransition cases (some regret)
- Athletic advantage data

Different studies, different interpretations, different conclusions.

**The Rapid Change:**

From 2010-2024:

- Trans population grew dramatically (more awareness or social contagion? Depends who you ask)
- Especially trans-identified youth
- Gender-affirming care expanded
- Backlash intensified

Both sides see this as evidence:

- Trans advocates: Finally safe to come out
- Critics: Social contagion, trend

**The Class & Elite Dimension:**

Often missing: Gender discourse is elite/educated/urban

- Working-class people often confused
- Elite institutions (universities, corporations) adopt
- Rural/religious communities resist
- Class resentment fuels backlash

“Pronouns in bio” signals class/education status.

**What Gets Lost:**

While fighting about bathrooms and pronouns:

- Trans people face violence, discrimination
- Gender non-conforming people harmed by rigid norms
- Intersex infants subjected to unnecessary surgeries
- Mental health crisis among trans youth
- But also: Rushed medical transitions, detransitioners need support

The polarization makes nuance impossible.

**The European Dimension:**

Not just U.S. culture war:

- UK: Fierce TERF vs. trans debates
- Nordic countries: Restricting youth transition
- Eastern Europe: Anti-gender movements
- Shows global nature of conflict

**Moving Forward?**

No consensus possible currently. Too fundamental. People disagree about:

- What gender IS
- Whether it’s real/constructed/biological
- What claims it justifies
- How to protect different groups

“Gender” now means opposite things depending on speaker.

**The Meta-Question:**

Can a society function when people mean completely different things by “man” and “woman”? When even “what is a woman?” can’t be answered without sparking rage?

This isn’t just about a word - it’s about reality itself.

-----

*This entry demonstrates how a neutral grammatical term can become the center of civilizational culture wars when it intersects with identity, bodies, rights, children, and competing truth claims. “Gender” may be the most contested word in contemporary English, with irreconcilable definitions producing irreconcilable politics.*
