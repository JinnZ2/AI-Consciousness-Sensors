# Woke

## Original Definition & Historical Context

**Original Definition (1930s-1960s):**
“Woke” originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as the past tense of “wake,” but gained specific political meaning as a metaphor for awareness of social injustice, particularly racism. Early usage emphasized:

- **Consciousness** - Being aware of systemic oppression
- **Vigilance** - Staying alert to injustice and deception
- **Racial Justice** - Specifically awareness of racism and discrimination
- **Community Knowledge** - Information not acknowledged by mainstream/white society
- **Self-Protection** - Awareness as survival strategy for Black Americans

**Historical Context:**
The term emerged during the Jim Crow era when Black Americans needed to be literally “awake” to:

- Sundown towns and dangerous areas
- Police brutality and legal injustice
- Economic exploitation
- Social codes and rules for survival in racist society

Being “woke” meant understanding the reality of systemic racism that white society denied or ignored.

**Early Usage:**

- **1923** - Possible early usage by Marcus Garvey: “Wake up Ethiopia! Wake up Africa!”

## Analysis

“Woke” represents perhaps the fastest and most complete semantic inversion in modern political language. In less than a decade, it transformed from:

- **Black community term for racial justice awareness**
- → **Mainstream progressive identity marker**
- → **Corporate branding tool**
- → **Right-wing slur for any progressive position**

**The Trajectory of Appropriation:**

**Phase 1: Origin (1930s-2000s)** - Specific, meaningful term within Black communities about survival and racial justice awareness.

**Phase 2: Mainstreaming (2013-2016)** - BLM brings term to national attention. Still primarily about racial justice but expanding to other social justice issues.

**Phase 3: Dilution (2016-2018)** - Non-Black people adopt term. Corporate co-optation. Meaning expands to general progressivism, losing specificity.

**Phase 4: Weaponization (2017-Present)** - Conservative media inverts term into pejorative. Applied to anything vaguely progressive. Original meaning erased.

**Phase 5: Saturation (2020-Present)** - Term so overused it means everything and nothing. Original communities abandon it.

**The Core Theft:**
“Woke” was stolen twice:

1. **First theft (Liberal/Corporate)**: Non-Black progressives and brands appropriated Black cultural term, diluting its specific racial justice meaning
1. **Second theft (Conservative)**: Right-wing completed the inversion, making awareness of oppression into the new oppression

**Result**: A term that meant “awareness of systemic racism” now often means “excessive progressivism I dislike.”

**The Irony:**

- **Original**: “Wake up to see oppressive systems”
- **Current right-wing usage**: “Woke people are oppressing us with their awareness”

The term has been flipped to make the awareness of injustice the problem, rather than the injustice itself.

**Why This Matters:**
The theft of “woke” isn’t just semantic quibbling. It’s a way of:

- Erasing Black voices from discourse about their own terminology
- Delegitimizing social justice activism by making “awareness” seem extreme
- Creating boogeyman to rally against without engaging actual arguments
- Linguistic colonization - taking marginalized communities’ language and inverting it

**What Gets Lost:**
When “woke” meant awareness of racism, it pointed to real issues:

- Police brutality
- Mass incarceration
- Housing discrimination
- Wealth gaps
- Educational inequality

When “woke” means “annoying progressive,” those issues disappear from view.

**The Catch-22:**
Original “woke” communities now face an impossible choice:

- Keep using the term and fight for its meaning (exhausting, often futile)
- Abandon the term and let appropriators win (cultural erasure)
- Create new terminology (which will likely be stolen and inverted again)

**Contemporary Usage:**
By 2023-2024, “woke” has been applied to:

- Disney movies with Black characters
- Military diversity training
- Beer companies with trans spokespeople
- M&M’s redesigning candy mascots
- “Woke AI” that won’t write racist content

The term now means “something changed and I don’t like it,” which is about as far from “awareness of systemic racial injustice” as possible.

**Comparison to Other Stolen Terms:**
Like “politically correct” before it, “woke” shows how the right is adept at taking left-wing terminology and weaponizing it. But “woke” is unique because:

1. It came from marginalized community, not academia
1. The inversion happened remarkably quickly (5-7 years)
1. The semantic flip is nearly total

**The Future:**
Many activists have already moved on from “woke,” recognizing it as compromised. But the term persists in:

- Right-wing discourse (where it’s a useful villain)
- Mainstream confusion (where people aren’t sure what it means)
- Historical documentation (where we remember what it meant)

-----

*This entry demonstrates how terms from marginalized communities can be appropriated, diluted, inverted, and weaponized against their original users—all in less than a decade. The theft of “woke” is a case study in linguistic imperialism and semantic warfare, showing how those in power can colonize even the language of resistance.*
