# Marxism

## Original Definition & Historical Context

**Classical Definition (Mid-19th Century):**
Marxism refers to the social, political, and economic theories developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, primarily articulated in *The Communist Manifesto* (1848) and *Das Kapital* (1867-1894). Core tenets include:

- **Historical Materialism** - History driven by material economic conditions and class struggle
- **Dialectical Materialism** - Social change occurs through contradictions and their resolution
- **Labor Theory of Value** - Value created by labor; capitalists extract “surplus value”
- **Class Struggle** - History as conflict between exploiting and exploited classes
- **Revolutionary Change** - Capitalism will inevitably be overthrown by proletarian revolution
- **Dictatorship of the Proletariat** - Transitional state where workers control means of production
- **Communism** - Final stage: classless, stateless society with collective ownership

**Key Theorists:**

- Karl Marx (1818-1883) - German philosopher, economist, revolutionary
- Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) - Marx’s collaborator and financial supporter
- Focus: Analyzing capitalism’s contradictions and predicting its collapse

**Autonomist Marxism**

- Antonio Negri, Michael Hardt
- Worker self-activity, refusal of work
- Multitude vs. Empire

**Eco-Marxism**

- Combines Marxism with environmental concerns
- Metabolic rift theory
- Capitalism’s ecological contradictions

## Key Evolutionary Moments

**1. The Revisionists vs. Orthodox Split (1890s-1900s)**

- Eduard Bernstein argued for gradual reform over revolution
- Sparked debate: Can capitalism be reformed or must it be overthrown?
- Created divide between social democrats and revolutionary socialists

**2. Russian Revolution (1917)**

- First major “Marxist” revolution
- Lenin adapted theory to agrarian Russia (Marx predicted revolution in advanced industrial nations)
- Established template: vanguard party, one-party state
- Marxism transforms from theory to state ideology

**3. Stalin’s Consolidation (1920s-1953)**

- “Marxism-Leninism” becomes official doctrine
- Purges of competing interpretations
- “Diamat” (dialectical materialism) becomes rigid orthodoxy
- Marxism weaponized for authoritarian control

**4. Chinese Revolution (1949)**

- Mao adapts Marxism to Chinese conditions
- Peasant focus contradicts Marx’s industrial proletariat emphasis
- Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) - ideological purity campaigns
- Creates distinctly Asian variant

**5. Hungarian Uprising & Prague Spring (1956, 1968)**

- Challenges Soviet monopoly on Marxist interpretation
- “Socialism with a human face”
- Brutally suppressed, but showed diversity within Marxist thought

**6. New Left & Cultural Turn (1960s-1970s)**

- Western intellectuals move from economics to culture
- Herbert Marcuse, Frankfurt School gain influence
- Focus: Ideology, consciousness, cultural hegemony (Gramsci)
- Marxism enters academia, Western universities

**7. Fall of Soviet Union (1991)**

- Collapse of “actually existing socialism”
- Crisis of Marxist theory and practice
- Shift to “post-Marxism,” cultural studies

**8. Occupy Wall Street & Post-2008 Revival (2011+)**

- Financial crisis renews interest in Marx’s capitalism critique
- Focus on inequality (1% vs 99%)
- Often divorced from revolutionary politics

**9. “Cultural Marxism” Conspiracy Theory (2010s+)**

- Right-wing attribution of progressive social movements to Marxist plot
- Conflates unrelated progressive politics with Marxism
- Creates phantom enemy disconnected from actual Marxist theory

## Key Players & Institutions Driving Redefinitions

**Revolutionary Leaders:**

- Vladimir Lenin - Vanguard party theory, imperialism
- Leon Trotsky - Permanent revolution
- Joseph Stalin - Socialism in one country, authoritarian state socialism
- Mao Zedong - Peasant revolution, continuous revolution
- Fidel Castro, Che Guevara - Third World revolutionary movements
- Ho Chi Minh - Anti-colonial Marxism

**Intellectuals & Theorists:**

- Georg Lukács - Class consciousness
- Antonio Gramsci - Cultural hegemony
- Frankfurt School (Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse) - Critical theory
- Louis Althusser - Structural Marxism
- Slavoj Žižek - Contemporary Marxist philosophy

**Academic Movements:**

## Current Misuses & Distortions

**Common Modern Distortions:**

1. **“Marxism = Any Government Program”**
- Healthcare, education, infrastructure called “Marxist”
- Ignores that Marxism specifically calls for worker ownership of means of production
- Conflates social democracy with revolutionary socialism
1. **“Cultural Marxism” Conspiracy**
- Claims progressive social movements are secret Marxist plot
- Falsely attributes feminism, anti-racism, LGBTQ+ rights to Marxist strategy
- No actual connection to Marxist economic theory or class analysis
- Often antisemitic undertones (Frankfurt School focus)
1. **“Marxism = Totalitarianism”**
- Conflates Marx’s theories with Stalin’s authoritarian regime
- Ignores diversity of Marxist thought and democratic socialist traditions
- Treats worst historical outcomes as definitional
1. **“Marxism = Atheism/Anti-Religion”**
- Reduces nuanced critique of religion’s social role to simple opposition
- Ignores liberation theology and Christian socialism
- “Opium of the masses” quote taken out of context
1. **“Identity Politics = Marxism”**
- Modern focus on race, gender, sexuality labeled “Marxist”
- Orthodox Marxism actually subordinated these to class struggle
- Many identity-focused movements explicitly reject Marxist class reductionism
1. **“Anyone Left of Center = Marxist”**
- Joe Biden, Barack Obama called “Marxist” by opponents
- Ignores that neither advocates worker ownership of production
- Renders term meaningless through overuse
1. **“Marxism = Sharing/Collectivism”**
- Reduces complex economic theory to vague notion of “sharing is caring”
- Ignores specific analysis of capital, labor, and production relations
- Treats it as moral philosophy rather than systematic social theory
1. **“Postmodern Neo-Marxism”**
- Combines Marxism with postmodernism despite fundamental incompatibility
- Marxism: Grand narrative, historical materialism, objective truth
- Postmodernism: Skepticism of grand narratives, relativism
- Creates incoherent boogeyman

## Analysis

“Marxism” has undergone perhaps the most dramatic semantic drift of any political-economic term. What began as a specific analytical framework for understanding capitalism and predicting its transformation has been:

**Stretched beyond recognition**: Applied to phenomena Marx never addressed (identity politics, postmodernism) and political positions he would reject (social democracy, reformism)

**Weaponized politically**: Used as scare word divorced from actual content - “Marxist” now simply means “political thing I don’t like”

**Fragmented into incompatible variants**: Leninist, Stalinist, Maoist, Trotskyist, Western, Analytical, Autonomist versions often contradict each other and Marx’s original writings

**Conflated with outcomes**: Historical atrocities committed by regimes claiming Marxist inspiration treated as definitional rather than contested implementations

**Academicized and depoliticized**: Western universities study “Marxist analysis” while abandoning revolutionary politics Marx saw as essential

The result: Two parallel universes of meaning

- **Academic/Left**: Sophisticated analytical tool for understanding capitalism, power, and social change
- **Popular/Right**: Totalitarian ideology seeking to destroy Western civilization through cultural subversion

These definitions share almost no common ground, making productive dialogue nearly impossible. Someone defending “Marxist analysis of labor relations” and someone warning against “Marxist indoctrination in schools” are using the same word for entirely different concepts.

**The core problem**: Marx’s theories were fundamentally about economics and class, but “Marxism” is now applied to virtually any progressive position on any topic, whether or not it has anything to do with workers seizing means of production.

*This entry illustrates how a complex theoretical framework can be simultaneously over-expanded (to cover everything) and over-simplified (to mean “bad leftism”), rendering the term analytically useless while maintaining emotional/political charge.*
