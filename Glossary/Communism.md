# Communism

## Original Definition & Historical Context

**Classical Definition (Mid-19th Century):**
Communism originally referred to a theoretical endpoint of social development where class distinctions have been abolished and the means of production are commonly owned. In Marxist theory specifically, communism represents:

- **Classless Society** - No distinction between owners and workers; no class exploitation
- **Stateless Society** - The state “withers away” as class antagonisms disappear
- **Common Ownership** - Means of production owned collectively by all
- **“From Each According to Ability, To Each According to Need”** - Distribution based on need, not labor contribution
- **Abolition of Private Property** - In productive property specifically, not personal possessions
- **End of Alienation** - Workers no longer separated from products of their labor
- **Abundant Production** - Material scarcity overcome through advanced productive forces

**Key Theorists:**

- **Karl Marx (1818-1883)** - Defined communism as final stage beyond socialism
- **Friedrich Engels (1820-1895)** - Co-developed theory with Marx
- **Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921)** - Anarchist communism, mutual aid
- **Rosa Luxemburg (1871-1919)** - Revolutionary democracy, mass action

**Historical Context:**
Marx distinguished communism from earlier “utopian” communist ideas:

- **Primitive Communism** - Pre-class tribal societies with common ownership
- **Early Christian Communism** - Acts 4:32-35, “all things in common”
- **Thomas More’s Utopia (1516)** - Fictional communist society
- **Gerrard Winstanley & Diggers (1649)** - English communist agrarian movement

Marx argued his “scientific communism” was inevitable outcome of capitalism’s contradictions, not a moral ideal to be wished into existence.

## Current Misuses & Distortions

**Common Modern Distortions:**

1. **“Communism = Socialism = Marxism”**
- Treats three distinct concepts as identical
- Communism is theoretical endpoint; socialism is transition or separate tradition
- Many socialists explicitly reject communism
- Collapses century of ideological debate
1. **“Communism = When Government Controls Everything”**
- Ironically, Marx’s communism is STATELESS
- Confuses Stalinist command economy with communist theory
- Ignores that communism theoretically means no government
1. **“Communism Killed 100 Million People”**
- Refers to *Black Book of Communism* (1997) figure
- Highly contested methodology (includes Nazi soldiers killed by USSR, potential births)
- Conflates different regimes, famines, and policies
- Not defending atrocities, but number is propaganda tool
- Real death tolls in tens of millions still horrific
1. **“China/Vietnam = Communist”**
- Both have market economies, private property, billionaires
- “Communist” only describes ruling party, not economic system
- Shows term maintains political but not economic meaning
1. **“Nazis Were Communists”**
- Because “National Socialism” has “socialism” in name
- Nazis imprisoned/killed communists, destroyed unions
- Privatized industries, allied with capitalists
- Ideologically opposed (nationalism vs. internationalism, racial hierarchy vs. class analysis)
1. **“Communism Sounds Good In Theory”**
- Dismissive cliché
- Implies theory is irrelevant to practice
- Ignores that Marx claimed theory based on material analysis, not ideals
1. **“Cultural Marxism = Communism”**
- False equation of progressive social views with economic communism
- Frankfurt School critics of both capitalism AND Soviet communism
- Conspiracy theory with no basis in communist theory
1. **“Democrats/Biden = Communists”**
- Applied to center-left politicians who support capitalism
- No advocacy for common ownership or abolition of private property
- Renders term meaningless through overuse
1. **“Communism = No Personal Property”**
- Marx distinguished personal property (possessions) from private property (means of production)
- “Abolition of private property” meant factories, not toothbrushes
- “They’ll take your house” scare tactic
1. **“Communism = Atheism”**
- Marx critiqued religion’s social function, but many communists were religious
- Liberation theology, Christian communists exist
- Soviet state atheism was Stalinist policy, not definitional to communism
1. **“Real Communism Has Never Been Tried”**
- Leftist claim that USSR, China weren’t “real communism”
- Technically true by Marx’s definition (stateless, classless achieved nowhere)
- But dodges question of why attempts produced authoritarianism
- “No True Scotsman” fallacy

- **2010s** - Internet leftists reclaim hammer and sickle aesthetics
- **2020s** - “Communist” as right-wing insult for any progressive policy

## Analysis

“Communism” presents a unique case of semantic displacement: the gap between theory and practice became so vast that the term essentially refers to two incompatible things.

**Theoretical Communism (Marx):**

- Stateless, classless, abundant society
- Outcome of historical development
- Highest form of human freedom
- Never actually existed

**“Actually Existing Communism” (USSR, China, etc.):**

- Totalitarian one-party states
- Massive state apparatus and bureaucracy
- Scarcity, repression, surveillance
- Directly contradicts theoretical definition

**The Paradox**: Countries called “communist” were building “socialism” as transition to communism (which they never reached), while practicing systems that looked nothing like Marx’s vision. Yet they monopolized the term, so “communism” came to mean “Soviet-style authoritarianism” rather than its theoretical content.

**Cold War Weaponization**: The term became a propaganda tool:

- **West**: “Communist” = totalitarian enemy threatening freedom
- **East**: “Communist” = liberator of workers from capitalist exploitation
- Both sides used it to justify repression, intervention, military buildup

**Result**: “Communism” now triggers emotional response rather than analytical thinking:

- **Older generations** (especially from former Eastern Bloc): Visceral negative reaction based on lived experience
- **Young Western leftists**: Sometimes romanticize it, ignorant of historical reality
- **Right-wing politics**: Use as scare word for any government action
- **Serious political theory**: Struggle to discuss Marx’s ideas without triggering associations with Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot

**The Naming Problem**: Every regime claiming to build communism produced authoritarianism. Does this mean:

- A) The theory inevitably leads to dictatorship?
- B) The theory was hijacked/misapplied?
- C) Historical conditions prevented proper implementation?
- D) The theory itself was flawed from the start?

This debate can’t be resolved because “communism” now means both the theory AND its failed implementations, making clear analysis nearly impossible.

**Contemporary Confusion**:

- China: “Communist Party” ruling capitalist economy
- Cuba: “Communist” state allowing small businesses
- North Korea: Hereditary monarchy calling itself communist

The term has become almost purely symbolic - a marker of political identity divorced from actual economic organization.

*This entry demonstrates how a theoretical concept can be so thoroughly associated with its worst attempted implementations that the original idea becomes inaccessible. The gap between Marx’s stateless utopia and Stalin’s totalitarian state is so vast that they barely share a vocabulary, yet both are called “communism.”*
