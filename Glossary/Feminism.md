# Feminist

## Original Definition & Historical Context

**Early Usage (1890s-1910s):**
“Feminism” emerged in France (“féminisme”) in the 1880s and entered English usage around 1895-1910. The term originally emphasized:

- **Women’s Rights** - Legal, political, and social equality
- **Suffrage** - Right to vote as immediate political goal
- **Economic Independence** - Access to education, professions, property rights
- **Legal Personhood** - Married women’s property rights, divorce access
- **Bodily Autonomy** - Control over reproduction (controversial even then)

**Historical Context:**
Emerged during period when women in most Western countries:

- Could not vote
- Had limited property rights
- Were excluded from most professions
- Could not serve on juries
- Had restricted access to higher education
- Were legally subordinate to husbands

**Early Usage vs. “Women’s Rights Movement”:**
Initially “feminist” was more radical than “suffragist” - it implied broader social transformation, not just voting rights.

**Early Figures:**

- **Mary Wollstonecraft** - *Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (1792) - Before “feminist” term existed

## Analysis

“Feminist” presents a unique case: a term that has been simultaneously embraced, rejected, reclaimed, and weaponized across more than a century.

**The Core Tension:**

**What feminism claims to be:** Movement for gender equality, women’s liberation from oppression

**What opponents say it is:** Anti-men, anti-family, anti-biology, destroyer of civilization

This gap is so vast that “feminist” essentially means opposite things depending on who’s speaking.

**The “I’m Not a Feminist, But…” Phenomenon:**

For decades, many women expressed feminist views while rejecting the label:

- “I believe in equal pay, but I’m not a feminist”
- “I think women should vote, but I’m not one of those feminists”

This suggests successful propaganda making “feminist” toxic while feminist goals remain popular. By 2010s, this began shifting - younger women reclaiming “feminist” as proud identity.

**The Waves Model - Useful or Limiting?**

**First Wave** (suffrage) → **Second Wave** (liberation) → **Third Wave** (complexity) → **Fourth Wave?** (digital)

This narrative:

- ✓ Provides structure
- ✓ Shows evolution
- ✗ Erases continuous Black feminism, global feminism
- ✗ Implies linear progress (not true)
- ✗ Western-centric

Alternative: Feminisms (plural) always existed simultaneously.

**The Intersectionality Revolution:**

Perhaps the most significant evolution: Recognition that gender can’t be separated from race, class, sexuality, disability, etc.

- **1970s white feminism**: “All women share common oppression”
- **Black feminists**: “Actually, our experiences are completely different”
- **Result**: Intersectional analysis becomes mainstream (in theory if not always practice)

This complicates simple narratives about “what feminism is.”

**The TERF Wars:**

The trans inclusion debate reveals tensions:

- **Trans-inclusive feminists** (majority): Trans women are women, deserve feminist solidarity
- **“Gender critical” feminists**: Biological sex matters, trans women threaten women’s spaces

This is perhaps the bitterest internal feminist debate currently. Both sides claim feminist legitimacy. The conflict reveals:

- Biological essentialism vs. social constructivism
- Inclusivity vs. exclusivity tensions
- How feminism defines “woman”

**Corporate Co-optation:**

“Feminism” became marketable in 2010s:

- Dior “We Should All Be Feminists” T-shirts ($700)
- CIA recruitment ads: “I am a woman of color, a cisgender millennial… I am an intersectional feminist”
- “Girlboss” culture, Lean In feminism
- More female drone pilots as “progress”

This raised questions: Can feminism be compatible with capitalism? Empire? Or does this represent absorption and neutralization of radical movement?

**The Backlash Cycle:**

Every feminist advance triggers reaction:

1. Women gain rights/visibility
1. “Feminism has gone too far”
1. Women blamed for social problems
1. Rollback of gains
1. Renewed activism

Examples:

- 1920s flapper backlash → 1950s domestic ideology
- 1970s liberation → 1980s backlash (Faludi)
- 2010s #MeToo → 2020s “men are victims of feminism”

**Men’s Rights Activism & The Manosphere:**

Anti-feminist movements claiming men are oppressed by feminism:

- MRAs (Men’s Rights Activists)
- Pickup Artists (PUA)
- MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way)
- Incels (Involuntary Celibates)

These groups blame feminism for:

- Male suicide rates
- Custody arrangements
- False accusations
- Dating difficulties
- “Feminization” of society

Some legitimate issues (men’s mental health) mixed with misogyny. Creates pipeline to far-right.

**The Jordan Peterson Effect:**

Intellectual opposition to feminism from evolutionary psychology, “natural differences” arguments. Massive following among young men who feel feminism attacks them.

**The “Feminism Is Cancer” Era (2014-2017):**

Gamergate crystallized online anti-feminism:

- Harassment campaigns as entertainment
- Feminist critics of games face death threats
- Proto-alt-right organizing
- Made anti-feminism cool for young men

This passed somewhat but normalized extreme anti-feminist rhetoric online.

**Current State:**

“Feminist” in 2024 means:

- **To supporters**: Advocate for gender equality, social justice
- **To moderate opponents**: Misguided but well-meaning
- **To hardline opponents**: Destroyer of civilization, cause of all social decay
- **To corporations**: Marketing demographic
- **To young women**: Often proud identity
- **To young men**: Often immediate turn-off (incel/MRA influence)

**The Question of Relevance:**

Some claim feminism is obsolete (postfeminist era), others say it’s more urgent than ever. Evidence both ways:

- **Progress**: Voting, education, workplace access, legal equality (on paper)
- **Persistent issues**: Wage gap, sexual violence, reproductive rights under attack, representation gaps, care work burden

**What Gets Lost in the Battles:**

While arguing about whether feminism is good or evil:

- Women still do majority of unpaid care work
- Sexual assault remains epidemic
- Maternal mortality (especially for Black women)
- Economic inequality
- Global women’s oppression

The term became so contested that discussing actual issues becomes difficult.

**Moving Forward?:**

Some advocate new terminology to escape baggage, but “feminist” has power precisely because it’s contested. Abandoning it might mean conceding ground.
