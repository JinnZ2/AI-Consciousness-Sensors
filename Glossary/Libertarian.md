# Libertarian

## Original Definition & Historical Context

**Original Definition (Mid-19th Century):**
“Libertarian” was first used as a political term by French anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque in 1857 to describe anti-authoritarian leftists who opposed both capitalism and the state. The term emphasized:

- **Anti-Authoritarianism** - Opposition to state power and hierarchy
- **Individual Liberty** - Freedom from coercion
- **Voluntary Association** - Free cooperation without bosses or rulers
- **Anti-Capitalism** - Private property as hierarchical and coercive
- **Collective Ownership** - Common control of resources
- **Mutual Aid** - Cooperative rather than competitive social organization

**Original Context:**
Early libertarians were LEFT-WING anarchists who saw both capitalism and government as oppressive. They fought for:

- Workers’ control of production
- Abolition of wage labor
- Dismantling hierarchies (including private ownership)
- Revolutionary transformation of society

**Key Early Figures:**

- **Joseph Déjacque (1821-1864)** - Coined the term “libertarian” for anarcho-communism
- **Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921)** - Anarchist communism, mutual aid
- **Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876)** - Collectivist anarchism, opposed Marx
- **Errico Malatesta (1853-1932)** - Italian anarchist theorist
- **Sébastien Faure (1858-1942)** - French anarchist, synthesis anarchism

These thinkers called themselves “libertarian” to distinguish from authoritarian socialists/communists.

## Current Misuses & Distortions

**Common Modern Distortions:**

1. **“Libertarian = Republican Who Smokes Weed”**
- Reduces libertarianism to cultural liberalism + fiscal conservatism
- Ignores principled opposition to military spending, police state, corporate subsidies
- Many “libertarians” vote Republican anyway
1. **“Libertarian = Selfish/Greedy”**
- Moral critique rather than political description
- Ignores libertarian theories of mutual benefit, voluntary charity
- Conflates advocacy for markets with personal selfishness
1. **“Libertarian = Anarchist”**
- Most American libertarians are minarchists, not anarchists
- Ironically, original libertarians WERE anarchists
- Anarcho-capitalists are small minority
1. **“Libertarian = Socially Liberal, Fiscally Conservative”**
- Oversimplification that fits two-axis political compass
- Doesn’t capture philosophical foundations
- Makes libertarianism seem like mere mixture of left/right
1. **“Libertarian = No Government Regulation Ever”**
- Caricature of the position
- Most libertarians accept some role for courts, contract enforcement
- Debate is about extent, not absolute abolition
1. **“Libertarian = Corporate Shill”**
- Left critique that libertarians serve corporate interests
- Some validity (Koch brothers funding)
- But ignores anti-corporate left-libertarians and original anti-capitalist roots
1. **“Libertarian Socialism = Oxymoron”**
- Only makes sense if “libertarian” means right-wing
- Erases original meaning of term
- Noam Chomsky: “Libertarian socialist is a bit of a redundancy”
1. **“Libertarians Want No Roads”**
- Mocking “who will build the roads?” question
- Caricature, but some anarcho-capitalists do advocate private roads
- Not representative of most libertarians
1. **“Libertarians = States’ Rights Advocates”**
- Conflates libertarianism with American conservatism
- Many libertarians oppose state government coercion too
- Ron Paul influence created this association
1. **“Libertarian = Right-Wing”**
- Only true for post-1950s American usage
- Erases century of left-libertarian tradition
- Geographic/temporal bias

## Analysis

“Libertarian” represents one of the most dramatic and deliberate acts of semantic appropriation in political history. What began as a term for anti-capitalist anarchists was consciously stolen by free-market advocates who wanted to avoid the negative connotations of “conservative” or “classical liberal.”

**Murray Rothbard was explicit about this theft**, writing in the 1960s about the need to appropriate “libertarian” from the left. In one sense, this was brilliant branding - the term emphasizes liberty while avoiding associations with conservatism. In another sense, it created massive confusion and erased an entire political tradition.

**The Result: Geographic Divide**

- **United States**: “Libertarian” means right-wing, pro-capitalist, minimal government
- **Europe/Latin America**: “Libertarian” still often means anarchist, anti-capitalist left
- Neither side acknowledges the other as legitimate users of the term

**Philosophical Incoherence:**
The appropriation created paradoxes:

- **Original libertarians**: Freedom requires abolishing capitalism (wage labor is coercive)
- **Modern libertarians**: Freedom requires protecting capitalism (private property is liberty)

These are incompatible definitions of freedom itself:

- **Positive liberty** (freedom to) vs. **Negative liberty** (freedom from)
- **Freedom from bosses** vs. **Freedom to be a boss**

**Questions the Term Can’t Answer Anymore:**

- Can you be libertarian and socialist? (Yes, originally / No, in American usage)
- Can you be libertarian and capitalist? (No, originally / Yes, in American usage)
- Is private property libertarian? (Depends entirely on which tradition you’re in)

**Contemporary Confusion:**
When Noam Chomsky calls himself a “libertarian socialist,” Americans are confused because they think “libertarian” means Rand Paul. When American libertarians celebrate “economic freedom,” European anarchists are confused because they see capitalism as unfreedom.

**The Deeper Issue:** The term’s reversal reveals fundamental disagreements about the nature of freedom itself. Is the boss-worker relationship voluntary or coercive? Is taxation theft or social obligation? Is private property natural or constructed?

Because “libertarian” has been claimed by both sides of these debates, the term no longer facilitates discussion - it obscures fundamental differences in worldview.

**Winner of the Appropriation:**
In English-speaking discourse, especially online, the right-wing American meaning has largely won. Original left-libertarians now have to constantly explain they’re using the “original” definition, suggesting the term has been successfully captured.

*This entry illustrates how political terms can be deliberately appropriated and inverted by opposing movements, creating confusion that serves to erase historical traditions and make genuine political dialogue nearly impossible. The theft of “libertarian” represents linguistic imperialism - the American right took a European left-wing term and made it mean the opposite.*
