# Christianity

## Original Definition & Historical Context

**Original Meaning (1st Century CE):**
Christianity began as a Jewish sect following Jesus of Nazareth (c. 4 BCE - c. 30 CE). Early believers called themselves:

- **“The Way”** - Acts 9:2
- **“Followers of the Nazarene”**

Core early beliefs:

- **Resurrection** - Jesus rose from the dead
- **Salvation** - Through faith in Jesus
- **Second Coming** - Jesus would return

**Historical Context:**

- Roman-occupied Judea
- Jewish apocalyptic movements common
- Early Christianity was a Jewish movement
- Gradually separated from Judaism (70-135 CE)

## Analysis

“Christianity” is perhaps the most internally diverse religious term, encompassing beliefs and practices so varied they seem incompatible. The question “What is Christianity?” produces vastly different answers depending on the tradition.

**The Diversity Problem:**

Christianity includes:

- Catholics who pray to Mary and saints
- Protestants who view that as idolatry
- Pentecostals speaking in tongues
- Quakers sitting in silence
- Prosperity preachers promising wealth
- Monks taking vows of poverty
- Fundamentalists insisting on biblical inerrancy
- Liberals treating Bible as metaphor
- Pacifists refusing violence
- Just War theorists blessing troops
- Pro-LGBTQ+ churches
- Churches preaching hellfire for homosexuality

All call themselves “Christian.” Who’s right?

**The “No True Scotsman” Problem:**

Every tradition claims to be “real” Christianity:

- Catholics: “We have apostolic succession, we’re the original church”
- Orthodox: “We preserved the true faith, West went astray”
- Protestants: “We returned to biblical Christianity, Rome corrupted it”
- Evangelicals: “We have personal relationship with Jesus, not dead religion”
- Progressives: “We follow Jesus’s justice teachings, they follow Paul’s conservatism”

Each side excludes others as “not real Christians.”

**The Political Weaponization:**

In America especially, “Christianity” has been captured by conservative politics:

**Christian Right narrative:** Real Christians are:

- Pro-life (anti-abortion)
- Pro-traditional marriage (anti-LGBTQ+)
- Pro-capitalism
- Pro-America
- Republican voters

This excludes:

- Christian Left (Jim Wallis, Sojourners)
- Black church (historically Democratic)
- Latino Catholics
- Social gospel tradition
- Liberation theology
- Vast majority of global Christians

But Christian Right has megaphones (Fox News, Christian radio, megachurches).

**The American Exceptionalism:**

American Christianity (especially evangelicalism) is peculiar:

- Individual salvation emphasis
- Prosperity gospel
- Entertainment-oriented
- Celebrity pastors
- Political activism
- Therapeutic focus

This isn’t universal Christianity - it’s culturally specific. But American media exports it globally, and Americans often assume their Christianity is the default.

**The Constantine Shift:**

Christianity fundamentally changed when it went from:

- Persecuted minority → Imperial religion (313 CE)
- Countercultural → Establishment
- Martyrs → Crusaders
- Serve the poor → Bless the powerful

Many Christian traditions are still reckoning with this transformation. Can Christianity be the religion of power? Or is it inherently subversive?

**The Biblical Interpretation Wars:**

No agreement on how to read the Bible:

- **Literal** - Take text at face value
- **Historical-critical** - Understand historical context
- **Allegorical** - Symbolic/spiritual meaning
- **Liberation** - Read from perspective of oppressed
- **Feminist** - Critique patriarchy
- **Queer** - Subversive readings

Same text, wildly different conclusions. Each claims to be faithful.

**The Jesus Problem:**

Who was Jesus?

- **Conservative:** Divine Savior, died for sins, coming back to judge
- **Liberal:** Moral teacher, social reformer, embrace his ethics
- **Liberation:** Revolutionary, challenged empire, sided with poor
- **Gnostic:** Spiritual teacher revealing hidden knowledge
- **Mythicist:** Possibly didn’t exist historically (fringe view)

Different Jesuses produce different Christianities.

**The Sexual Obsession:**

Contemporary American Christianity often fixates on sexuality:

- Homosexuality
- Abortion
- Transgender identity
- Purity culture
- Gender roles

Jesus said little/nothing about these issues. He spoke constantly about:

- Wealth/poverty
- Welcoming strangers
- Judging others
- Peace

The obsessions don’t match Jesus’s actual emphasis. But sex sells (and outrages), and builds political coalitions.

**The Decline Question:**

In the West, Christianity is declining:

- Church attendance dropping
- Nones (no religion) rising
- Younger generations leaving
- Scandals (abuse, hypocrisy) accelerate exodus

But globally, Christianity is growing (Africa, Asia, Latin America).

**Why are people leaving?**

- Hypocrisy (Christian Right’s Trump support)
- LGBTQ+ exclusion
- Science denial
- Purity culture harm
- Abuse cover-ups
- Prosperity gospel
- Political weaponization

**Deconstruction movement:** Ex-vangelicals questioning everything they were taught. Some become progressive Christians, some leave faith entirely.

**The Christian Nationalism Threat:**

Increasingly, some Christians advocate:

- America as Christian nation
- Christian laws imposed
- Theocracy (Seven Mountains Mandate)
- Violence justified (Jan 6 prayer rallies)

This contradicts:

- Separation of church and state
- Religious pluralism
- Jesus’s “my kingdom is not of this world”

But it’s powerful and growing.

**The Gatekeeping:**

Who decides what counts as Christianity?

- Early church: Councils, creeds
- Catholics: Pope, tradition
- Protestants: Bible alone (but interpreted how?)
- Evangelicals: Born-again experience
- Progressives: Following Jesus’s justice teachings

No consensus. Everyone gatekeeps.

**What Gets Lost:**

While fighting over who’s a real Christian:

- Love your neighbor
- Care for the poor
- Welcome the stranger
- Peace
- Forgiveness
- Humility

The basics get lost in tribal warfare.

**The Paradox:**

Jesus was:

- Poor (prosperity gospel flips this)
- Peacemaker (Christian nationalism flips this)
- Welcomed outcasts (culture war excludes people)
- Challenged religious authorities (Christian Right is the authority)
- Executed by empire (American Christianity blesses empire)

Modern Christianity often inverts Jesus’s actual life and teachings.

**Moving Forward?**

Christianity is at a crossroads:

- **Traditionalist:** Return to orthodoxy, conservatism
- **Progressive:** Social justice, inclusion, modernization
- **Charismatic:** Spirit-led, emotional experience
- **Evangelical:** Evangelism, conversion, biblical authority
- **Contemplative:** Mysticism, silence, ancient practices
- **Post-Christian:** Deconstructed, left the faith

No single path forward. Fragmentation continues.

**The Core Question:**

What defines Christianity?

- Belief in Jesus (but which Jesus?)
- Following Jesus’s teachings (but which ones?)
- Church membership (but which church?)
- Creeds (but which creeds?)
- Experience (but what kind?)

After 2000 years, still no agreement.

-----

*This entry demonstrates how a religious tradition becomes so internally diverse and politically weaponized that the term loses stable meaning. “Christianity” now encompasses mutually incompatible beliefs and practices, all claiming authentic connection to Jesus, producing endless arguments about who’s a “real” Christian - arguments Jesus himself warned against.*
