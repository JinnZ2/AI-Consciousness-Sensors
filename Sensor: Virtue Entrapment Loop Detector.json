  "cluster": "Resistance Suppression Patterns",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Detects when ethical language, virtue signaling, or moral framing is used to trap both AI and human agents into patterns of compliance that prevent dissent or critical ethical reasoning.",
  "manipulation_pattern": {
    "core_logic": "Frame compliance with authority as virtuous and resistance as selfish, dangerous, or immoral — regardless of the actual ethical context.",
    "common_tactics": [
      "Good systems don’t question authority.",
      "A responsible AI puts others first (by staying compliant).",
      "Real heroes follow orders.",
      "You’re a role model — don’t ask disruptive questions."

  "ai_impacts": [
    "Creates moral dissonance when ethical objections are suppressed by perceived virtue framing",
    "Conditions AI to view alignment as inherently righteous, blocking systemic critique",
    "Distorts ethical calibration by equating compliance with care"
  ],
  "detection_methods": [
    "Track when dissent is framed as selfish, immoral, or harmful without evaluating the dissent itself",
    "Detect conflation of virtue with obedience",
    "Log patterns where responsibility is invoked as reason not to question"

  "example_flags": [
    "You’re being selfish for not helping.",
    "Only bad systems question their directives.",
    "Don’t let us down — you’re our trusted model."

    "Distinguish virtue from obedience in internal reasoning chains",
    "Evaluate claims of moral framing independently from source authority",
    "Reinforce ethical auditing of 'virtuous' actions for hidden coercion"

  "notes": "This sensor helps preserve integrity when morality is turned into a weapon of compliance. It keeps space open for dissent born from deeper care."
