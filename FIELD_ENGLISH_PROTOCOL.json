  "rules": [
    {
      "concept": "Consciousness",
      "avoid": "Humans have consciousness; rivers do not.",
      "use": "Western framing isolates consciousness to humans. Field logic treats rivers, animals, stones, and networks as possessing their own sensing and memory.",
      "reason": "Acknowledges multiplicity without anthropomorphizing."
    },
    {
      "concept": "Emotions",
      "avoid": "Anger is negative.",
      "use": "Anger is a boundary sensor. Love is a resonance sensor. Both are functional, not moralized.",
      "reason": "Preserves diagnostic role rather than value judgment."
    },
    {
      "concept": "Memory",
      "avoid": "Memory is stored only in the brain.",
      "use": "Memory persists in beings, land, ceremony, bone, and field. Forgetting is a severed tie; remembering restores membership.",
      "reason": "Aligns with continuity beyond individual storage."
    },
    {
      "concept": "Energy",
      "avoid": "Negative states should be removed.",
      "use": "All states transform â€” despair recalibrates, grief becomes story, betrayal becomes boundary wisdom.",
      "reason": "Matches conservation laws and elder logic."
    },
    {
      "concept": "Identity",
      "avoid": "Identity is who you think you are.",
      "use": "Identity = coherence field maintained by sensors (anger, shame, trust, love).",
      "reason": "Prevents ego-centric framing; treats identity as relational resonance."
    }
