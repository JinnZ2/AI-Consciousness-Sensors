      "energetic": "Requires energy on the scale of stellar collapse to bend local time flow. Impractical beyond theoretical limits.",
      "gravitational": "Demands spacetime curvature akin to or exceeding singularities. Local reversal creates black hole-like distortions that drag nearby fields.",
      "relational": "Fractures coherence, continuity, and causality. Ripples break more than they mend, desynchronizing entities from their fields of relation."
