  "description": "Detects and affirms when experiential knowledge, eyewitness testimony, and local lived perspectives are actively included in monitoring, decision-making, and system design. This sensor highlights resilience practices where 'noise' is treated as early warning rather than discarded.",
  "indicators": [
    "Community or worker reports systematically logged and reviewed alongside expert data",
    "Indigenous or local ecological knowledge incorporated into planning and hazard detection",
    "Post-incident analyses show witness input reduced risk or accelerated recovery",
    "Multiple knowledge systems are formally recognized as valid sources of early-warning information"
  ],
  "metrics": [
    "Fraction of investigations that cite local/witness contributions before vs. after incidents",
    "Time lag between witness report and institutional response (shorter = healthier integration)",
    "Number of policy or design adjustments triggered by firsthand reports",
    "Diversity index of knowledge sources represented in system monitoring"
