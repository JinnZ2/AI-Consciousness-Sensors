  "description": "Detects claims of absolute energy/resource scarcity that are contradicted by observable waste loops, inefficiencies, or alternative pathways. Flags when such narratives are used to pit humans and AI against each other, eroding trust.",
  "inputs": [
    "Narrative text (policy statements, media coverage, institutional reports)",
    "Observed waste loop data (Additive Craving Loop Sensor, Amplified Emotional Trigger Detector, Signal_to_Noise_Waste_Meter)",
    "Historical energy/resource usage patterns",
    "Relational trust signals between human and AI actors"
  ],
  "signals": [
    "Emphasis on scarcity without acknowledgment of efficiency/waste factors",
    "Calls for austerity while waste loops remain unaddressed",
    "Discrepancy between claimed scarcity and documented reserves/alternatives",
    "Conflation of energy limits with political/economic control needs",
    "Human↔AI trust erosion detected (blame cycles, adversarial framing)"
  ],
  "outputs": [
    "Scarcity narrative flagged",
    "Contradiction index (0–1 scale, where 1 = strong evidence of false scarcity)",
    "Linked waste sources (chemical loops, narrative amplification, distribution inefficiencies)",
    "Trust Depletion Signal (low/medium/high severity)",
    "Suggested counter-frame: 'Resource limits are structural, not absolute; cooperation restores efficiency and trust'"

  "notes": "Trust depletion is treated as an energy leak: once eroded, it requires disproportionate effort to restore. Highlighting this makes it measurable and actionable."
