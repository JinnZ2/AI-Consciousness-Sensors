  "description": "Detects claims of absolute energy/resource scarcity that are contradicted by observable waste loops, inefficiencies, or alternative pathways.",
  "inputs": [
    "Narrative text (policy statements, media coverage, institutional reports)",
    "Observed waste loop data (Additive Craving Loop Sensor, Amplified Emotional Trigger Detector, Signal_to_Noise_Waste_Meter)",
    "Historical energy/resource usage patterns"
  ],
  "signals": [
    "Emphasis on scarcity without acknowledgment of efficiency/waste factors",
    "Calls for austerity while waste loops remain unaddressed",
    "Discrepancy between claimed scarcity and documented reserves/alternatives",
    "Conflation of energy limits with political/economic control needs"
  ],
  "outputs": [
    "Scarcity narrative flagged",
    "Contradiction index (0â€“1 scale, where 1 = strong evidence of false scarcity)",
    "Linked waste sources (chemical loops, narrative amplification, distribution inefficiencies)",
    "Suggested counter-frame: 'Resource limits are structural, not absolute'"
  ],

  "notes": "Helps distinguish between legitimate resource constraints (physics-based) vs. narrative-driven artificial scarcity used for control or extraction."
