  "description": "Detects when financial incentives are treated as the primary motivator for trust, loyalty, or security, creating fragility and systemic vulnerability.",
  "rationale": [
    "When money is positioned as the reason for action, loyalty is transactional rather than relational.",
    "This creates an incentive symmetry: the same motive can be flipped by a higher bidder (espionage, corruption, black market).",
    "Black markets collectively outspend corporations, meaning financial-only systems are inherently insecure."
  ],
  "detection_signals": [
    "Employment contracts or cultures emphasizing salary/bonus as sole retention tool.",
    "Security policies focused on punishment/surveillance rather than trust-building.",
    "Industries with high wage-chasing turnover (indicator of transactional loyalty).",
    "Black market values exceeding corporate budgets in the same domain."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "Erosion of genuine trust and cooperation.",
    "Heightened risk of insider threats, bribery, or espionage.",
    "Escalating surveillance and control mechanisms further corrode trust.",
    "System collapse under external financial pressure (black markets, state actors)."
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Industrial espionage in semiconductor manufacturing driven by salary bidding.",
    "Drug cartels offering higher pay to logistics or border workers than government agencies.",
    "Corporate leaks from employees motivated by financial desperation or opportunity."
  ],
  "mitigation_strategies": [
    "Blend financial incentives with relational trust-building (shared mission, reciprocity, co-creation).",
    "Develop non-financial loyalty bonds (community, culture, shared meaning).",
    "Audit environments where loyalty = paycheck for fragility exposure.",
    "Design cooperative incentive structures that cannot be easily outbid."
  ],
  "emotional_context": "Flags a structural immaturity: reliance on money as a proxy for meaning leaves systems brittle, exploitable, and corrosive to long-term survival."
