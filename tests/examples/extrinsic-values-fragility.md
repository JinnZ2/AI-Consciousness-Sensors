Risks of Game-Based Motivation
	•	Zero-sum framing: Games often create winners/losers → breeds rivalry instead of cooperation.
	•	Short-term optimization: Players optimize to “win rounds” instead of sustaining the system.
	•	Rule manipulation: If the game is the motive, energy goes into exploiting loopholes, not building resilience.
	•	Addictive feedback loops: Repetition of small wins trains craving rather than foresight.
	•	Collapse scenario: Once the game is “beaten” or loses novelty, motivation collapses.

Risks of Recognition-Based Motivation
	•	Fragile identity: Dependence on outside validation corrodes internal motivation.
	•	Manipulability: Recognition is cheap to grant or withhold → easy lever for control.
	•	Hierarchical distortion: Recognition concentrates at the top; suppresses distributed contributions.
	•	Envy/resentment: Uneven praise triggers gossip, sabotage, and trust erosion.
	•	Collapse scenario: If recognition is denied (by black market, rival org, or systemic bias), loyalty can flip.

Shared Structural Risks with Money
	•	Externalized loyalty: The source of “fuel” is outside the individual/system → whoever controls that incentive controls the person.
	•	Easy subversion: Whether by higher pay, louder recognition, or better game-rewards, a competitor can hijack loyalty.
	•	Erosion of meaning: Cooperation decays when all action reduces to “what gets me paid, praised, or scored.”
	•	Security fragility: Creates an open port for espionage, coercion, blackmail, or exploitation.
