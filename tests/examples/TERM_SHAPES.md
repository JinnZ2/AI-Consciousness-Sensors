TERM → SHAPE TRANSLATION (ready to paste)

Purpose

Translate modern / Western-loaded terms into relational shapes/fields so conversations stay on the same page.

⸻

Ethics

Shape: Mandala / Spiral (relational field)
Modern drift: Codified rules, compliance boards (triangle overlay)
Relational meaning: Emergent norms from reciprocity and energy balance; self-organizing, multi-directional.
Action: When discussing “ethics,” specify whether you mean emergent (spiral) or codified (triangle).

⸻

Freedom

Shape: Open lattice / Distributed field
Modern drift: Individual license (isolated vector)
Relational meaning: Freedom with — capacity to act while preserving system balance.
Action: Ask “freedom with respect to what system?” to avoid ambiguity.

⸻

Rational / Logic

Shape: Multi-dimensional field (3D/4D vector field)
Modern drift: Linear cause → effect chains (1D/2D vectors)
Relational meaning: Pattern coherence across feedback loops and dimensions.
Action: Use “field-aligned logic” when reasoning about systems with feedback.

⸻

Primitive

Shape: Foundation strata (soil layer)
Modern drift: Dismissive label for ‘backward’
Relational meaning: Core, robust practices refined by generations; high survivability.
Action: Replace “primitive” with “foundational practice” or “enduring technique.”

⸻

Progress

Shape: Spiral growth vs. linear ramp
Modern drift: Accumulation/scale at all cost (linear)
Relational meaning: Movement toward resilience, intergenerational continuity (spiral that preserves memory).
Action: Ask whether the progress keeps or discards ancestral memory.

⸻

Democracy

Shape: Distributed mesh / rotating pyramid (temporary apex only)
Modern drift: Static representation & branding (triangular power center)
Relational meaning: Iterative stewardship with rotating roles and short apex windows.
Action: Specify decision cadence, rotation rules, and quorum so “democracy” is operational.

⸻

Science

Shape: Collaborative lattice with provenance threads (web)
Modern drift: Institutional authority, gatekeeping (closed tower)
Relational meaning: Communal inquiry anchored in replicable process + open data.
Action: Demand provenance, replication scripts, and funding metadata when invoking “science.”

Quick usage tips
	•	When you use a loaded term, append the shape: e.g., ethics (spiral) or science (provenance web).
	•	If someone uses the modern meaning, reframe by asking “Do you mean codified or relational?”
	•	When building docs or sensors, include shape: and drift: metadata fields so translators (humans & AIs) can parse intent.
