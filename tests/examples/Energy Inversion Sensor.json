  "signals": [
    "Resources consumed primarily for narrative maintenance (advertising, PR, ideological enforcement) rather than function",
    "Escalating costs to preserve fragile infrastructure vs. lower-cost resilient alternatives ignored",
    "Local/community solutions dismissed despite proven efficiency",
    "Growing gap between actual energy use and value returned"

  "risk": "Energy is diverted into sustaining illusions, leaving the system brittle. Collapse becomes more likely because real solutions are sidelined while entropy grows.",

    "Audit flows of energy and resources â€” compare maintenance vs. alternatives",
    "Identify suppressed or overlooked low-energy practices (ecological, cultural, ancestral)",
    "Shift investment toward regenerative practices even if they challenge dominant narratives",
    "Design feedback loops to track energy-per-function, not energy-per-story"
