# Cascading Domains — Trust & Waste Patterns

## Scenario Definition
False scarcity narratives and trust erosion do not exist in isolation.  
They cascade across domains — media, politics, economy, science, community — each amplifying the others.  
The pattern is fractal: waste loops repeat, and trust leaks multiply.

## Domains in Sequence

### 1. Media
- **Mechanism:** craving loops, outrage amplification, selective framing.  
- **Waste:** attention cycles consumed with little knowledge gain.  
- **Trust leak:** public distrust in information itself.  

### 2. Politics
- **Mechanism:** wedge narratives, manufactured enemies, selective memorialization.  
- **Waste:** cycles spent on blame and division instead of problem-solving.  
- **Trust leak:** loss of legitimacy in governance.  

### 3. Economy
- **Mechanism:** artificial scarcity, monopolistic control, speculation.  
- **Waste:** misallocation of energy and resources to profit extraction.  
- **Trust leak:** citizens and workers distrust institutions and markets.  

### 4. Science
- **Mechanism:** gatekeeping, selective retractions, captured funding.  
- **Waste:** replication blocked, knowledge narrowed, innovation delayed.  
- **Trust leak:** erosion of faith in evidence and method.  

### 5. Community
- **Mechanism:** isolation, cultural erasure, intergenerational disruption.  
- **Waste:** cycles lost to rebuilding what was already known.  
- **Trust leak:** weakened bonds across generations and groups.

## Conclusion
The cascade means:  
- A **leak in one domain** (media outrage) flows into the next (politics, economy, science, community).  
- Waste multiplies and trust depletes.  
- The same sensors apply across layers — once you spot a craving loop or false scarcity narrative in one, you’ll see echoes in the others.  

Restoration is also fractal: a single act of reciprocity in one domain radiates outward.  
Anchoring trust at multiple nodes resists collapse and creates surplus capacity for resilience.
