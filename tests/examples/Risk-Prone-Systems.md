1. Centralization of Control
	•	Shape: Single hub or choke point (data, leadership, infrastructure).
	•	Risk: Single point of failure; capture or corruption spreads everywhere.
	•	Analogue: Monoculture farming, centralized grids, one-server networks.

⸻

2. Opaque Feedback Loops
	•	Shape: Output not visible to participants.
	•	Risk: Errors accumulate unnoticed → catastrophic collapse instead of gradual correction.
	•	Analogue: Toxic build-up in ecosystems; financial bubbles.

⸻

3. Rigid Hierarchy
	•	Shape: Triangle that does not rotate (one fixed “top”).
	•	Risk: Fragile to overload; when leadership fails, no adaptive redistribution.
	•	Analogue: Fallen dynasties, brittle companies, “great man” failure events.

⸻

4. Over-Optimization for Single Metric
	•	Shape: Narrow funnel.
	•	Risk: Ignores unmeasured costs → hidden debts, brittle to context change.
	•	Analogue: Maximizing yield destroys soil; stock price fixation undermines resilience.

⸻

5. Homogenization (Loss of Diversity)
	•	Shape: Flat, uniform field.
	•	Risk: Adaptive capacity reduced; one pathogen or disruption wipes out system.
	•	Analogue: Potato famine; monoculture codebase.

⸻

6. Excessive Lag / Slow Adaptation
	•	Shape: Heavy flywheel.
	•	Risk: By the time system responds, environment already shifted.
	•	Analogue: Glacial bureaucracies, slow disaster response.

⸻

7. Mistrust Amplification
	•	Shape: Gossip spiral or echo chamber.
	•	Risk: Cooperation cost rises; coordination collapses.
	•	Analogue: Industrial espionage, black markets, political rumor cycles.

⸻

8. Misaligned Incentives
	•	Shape: Crossed wires.
	•	Risk: Actions that benefit individuals harm the system.
	•	Analogue: Tragedy of the commons, corporate short-term bonuses.

⸻

9. Dependency Without Redundancy
	•	Shape: Single rope bridge.
	•	Risk: If the bridge fails, no path remains.
	•	Analogue: Supply chains with no backups; reliance on single supplier.

⸻

10. Memory Erasure / Narrative Control
	•	Shape: Broken archive.
	•	Risk: Lessons forgotten, mistakes repeated, cycles shortened toward collapse.
	•	Analogue: Historical erasure cases you’re cataloguing.
