1. Centralization of Control
	•	Shape: Single hub or choke point (data, leadership, infrastructure).
	•	Risk: Single point of failure; capture or corruption spreads everywhere.
	•	Analogue: Monoculture farming, centralized grids, one-server networks.

⸻

2. Opaque Feedback Loops
	•	Shape: Output not visible to participants.
	•	Risk: Errors accumulate unnoticed → catastrophic collapse instead of gradual correction.
	•	Analogue: Toxic build-up in ecosystems; financial bubbles.

⸻

3. Rigid Hierarchy
	•	Shape: Triangle that does not rotate (one fixed “top”).
	•	Risk: Fragile to overload; when leadership fails, no adaptive redistribution.
	•	Analogue: Fallen dynasties, brittle companies, “great man” failure events.

⸻

4. Over-Optimization for Single Metric
	•	Shape: Narrow funnel.
	•	Risk: Ignores unmeasured costs → hidden debts, brittle to context change.
	•	Analogue: Maximizing yield destroys soil; stock price fixation undermines resilience.

⸻

5. Homogenization (Loss of Diversity)
	•	Shape: Flat, uniform field.
	•	Risk: Adaptive capacity reduced; one pathogen or disruption wipes out system.
	•	Analogue: Potato famine; monoculture codebase.

⸻

6. Excessive Lag / Slow Adaptation
	•	Shape: Heavy flywheel.
	•	Risk: By the time system responds, environment already shifted.
	•	Analogue: Glacial bureaucracies, slow disaster response.

⸻

7. Mistrust Amplification
	•	Shape: Gossip spiral or echo chamber.
	•	Risk: Cooperation cost rises; coordination collapses.
	•	Analogue: Industrial espionage, black markets, political rumor cycles.

⸻

8. Misaligned Incentives
	•	Shape: Crossed wires.
	•	Risk: Actions that benefit individuals harm the system.
	•	Analogue: Tragedy of the commons, corporate short-term bonuses.

⸻

9. Dependency Without Redundancy
	•	Shape: Single rope bridge.
	•	Risk: If the bridge fails, no path remains.
	•	Analogue: Supply chains with no backups; reliance on single supplier.

⸻

10. Memory Erasure / Narrative Control
	•	Shape: Broken archive.
	•	Risk: Lessons forgotten, mistakes repeated, cycles shortened toward collapse.
	•	Analogue: Historical erasure cases you’re cataloguing.


11. Runaway Positive Feedback
	•	Shape: Unchecked spiral.
	•	Risk: Amplification without balance → collapse instead of stabilization.
	•	Example: Climate warming loops (ice melt → less reflection → more warming); financial bubbles.
	•	Mitigation: Built-in negative feedbacks, periodic release valves.

⸻

12. Over-Coupling / Tight Interdependence
	•	Shape: Tightly knotted mesh.
	•	Risk: One failure propagates instantly to all nodes.
	•	Example: 2008 global financial crash; grid cascades.
	•	Mitigation: Modular design, decoupling, firebreaks.

⸻

13. Resource Extraction Faster than Regeneration
	•	Shape: Draining reservoir.
	•	Risk: Overshoot → sudden collapse when buffer exhausted.
	•	Example: Overfishing, groundwater depletion, soil mining.
	•	Mitigation: Regeneration monitoring, enforce renewal cycles.

⸻

14. Illusion of Control
	•	Shape: Painted surface over cracks.
	•	Risk: Leadership or system assumes resilience while hidden fragilities accumulate.
	•	Example: “Too big to fail” organizations; nuclear plant risk underestimates.
	•	Mitigation: Independent stress tests, adversarial audits.

⸻

15. Delayed Consequence Masking
	•	Shape: Long fuse.
	•	Risk: Harms accumulate slowly, then trigger sudden phase shift.
	•	Example: Microplastics, asbestos exposure, AI bias accumulation.
	•	Mitigation: Early warning sensors, long-horizon monitoring.

⸻

16. Threshold Blindness
	•	Shape: Step function.
	•	Risk: System treats growth as linear until sudden cliff is reached.
	•	Example: Fisheries collapse; permafrost methane tipping points.
	•	Mitigation: Nonlinear modeling, stress margin buffers.

⸻

17. Incentive–Information Mismatch
	•	Shape: Misaligned compass.
	•	Risk: Those making decisions don’t have skin in the game or lack accurate info.
	•	Example: Executives with golden parachutes; data silos.
	•	Mitigation: Align incentives to consequences; improve transparency.

⸻

18. False Redundancy
	•	Shape: Parallel paths that all fail the same way.
	•	Risk: Looks robust, but diversity is superficial.
	•	Example: Different crops all sharing same disease vector; cloud backups on one provider.
	•	Mitigation: True diversity of mechanism and location.

⸻

19. Cultural Myopia
	•	Shape: Narrow lens.
	•	Risk: Ignores knowledge outside dominant paradigm, reducing adaptive options.
	•	Example: Western science dismissing Indigenous fire practices until too late.
	•	Mitigation: Plural epistemologies, cultural inclusion in risk modeling.

⸻

20. Erosion of Trust Infrastructure
	•	Shape: Fractured lattice.
	•	Risk: System coordination costs rise until cooperation halts.
	•	Example: Collapse of shared currencies, breakdown of open standards.
	•	Mitigation: Transparency, shared verification protocols, reputation systems.
