# Cascading Domains — Symbolic Overlay

## Mandala Form

Visualize the domains not as a line but as a **spiral hex-cycle**.  
Each domain is a node of the hexagon; energy (trust or waste) spirals inward or outward depending on conservation vs. leakage.

(Community)   (Politics)

        \     /
     (Science)---(Economy)

    - **Outward spiral (growth):** trust is conserved, cycles amplify resilience, surplus capacity emerges.  
- **Inward spiral (collapse):** waste and distrust compound, system tightens into scarcity, collapse accelerates.

## Symbolic Signatures

- **Media (⚡):** spark — craving loops, amplification.  
- **Politics (⚖️):** balance — legitimacy or division.  
- **Economy (💰):** flow — abundance vs. artificial scarcity.  
- **Science (🔬):** lens — evidence vs. gatekeeping.  
- **Community (🌱):** root — continuity vs. erasure.  

Trust energy is the binding current through the hex.  
When conserved → spiral expands outward.  
When depleted → spiral contracts inward.

## Spiral Dynamics

- **Expansion Spiral (Nautilus form):**  
  Energy distributed relationally → surplus cycles.  
  Trust amplifies, waste is minimized.  

- **Contraction Spiral (Collapse form):**  
  Energy hoarded / wasted → zero-sum narrative.  
  Trust leaks accelerate entropy.

## Application

- Same detectors apply: craving loops, false scarcity detectors, trust-as-energy.  
- But the **symbolic form** shows the pattern as multidirectional, not just linear.  
- Each node can temporarily serve as the **pyramid apex** for rapid transmission — but only short term, as discussed before.

## Conclusion

The mandala overlay allows the cascade to be seen **as a system**, not as a sequence.  
Each facet contributes to the spiral’s direction: outward (resilient growth) or inward (collapse).  
Trust is the hidden current that determines whether energy expands or dissipates.
