# Energy Inversion Example

## Case
A city spends **$50M annually** on advertising campaigns and subsidies to reassure the public that its centralized water system is “safe and modern.”  
Meanwhile, local cooperatives propose rainwater catchment and filtration projects requiring only **$5M startup + $1M annual maintenance**, but are dismissed as “unreliable.”

## Sensor Signals
- **Narrative maintenance > function**: majority of funds sustain trust messaging, not actual water delivery.  
- **Escalating costs**: central system requires increasing energy inputs (chemical treatments, pumping).  
- **Suppressed alternatives**: low-cost community systems ignored despite working elsewhere.  

## Risk
The city burns energy to maintain an illusion of stability. If the central system fails, collapse is sudden and severe because distributed solutions were never adopted.  

## Mitigation
- Audit comparative energy/resource flows.  
- Pilot distributed water catchments alongside central system.  
- Reallocate funding gradually to lower-cost resilient methods.
