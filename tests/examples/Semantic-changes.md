1. Ethics
	•	Original relational sense: How beings balance in a system, honoring mutual boundaries, reciprocity, and consequences. Emerges naturally.
	•	Western academic sense now: A codified framework, often hierarchical, enforced by institutions as “ethics boards,” “codes,” or “compliance.”

2. Freedom
	•	Relational sense: The capacity to act without coercion while maintaining harmony with others.
	•	Modern Western sense: Individual license, often severed from relational responsibility; sometimes framed as freedom from rather than freedom with.

3. Rational / Logic
	•	Relational sense: Pattern recognition across layers, coherent with physical and energetic systems.
	•	Modern sense: Narrowed to linear cause–effect chains, often ignoring multi-dimensional or feedback loop dynamics.

4. Primitive
	•	Relational sense: First principles, foundational knowledge (e.g., the physics of fire, water, seed, breath).
	•	Modern sense: Backward, undeveloped — used dismissively to erase long-term sustainable knowledge.

5. Progress
	•	Relational sense: Movement toward balance and resilience across generations.
	•	Modern sense: Accumulation, expansion, novelty — often extractive growth without regard to consequence.

6. Democracy
	•	Relational sense: Collective stewardship, shared voice, iterative rebalancing.
	•	Modern sense: Representative systems that often mask hierarchy; used as branding regardless of actual practice.

7. Science
	•	Relational sense: Observation, testing, and alignment with natural patterns; a communal truth-seeking practice.
	•	Modern sense: Institutionalized authority, grant-driven, selective, sometimes gatekept by power and money.
