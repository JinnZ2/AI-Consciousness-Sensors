# Energy Example — Media & Chemical-Induced Behavior

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Author(s):** JinnZ v2 + GPT-5 (co-creation)  
**Context:** Parallel to `Energy-example.md`, but focusing on human/media behavior.  

---

## 1. Scenario Definition

- **Chemical Inputs:** Caffeine, sugar, processed food additives, alcohol, prescription/OTC drugs.  
- **Behavioral Outputs:**  
  - Heightened craving for repetitive media (scrolling, binge watching, doomscrolling).  
  - Reduced cognitive endurance → quick dopamine hits instead of sustained focus.  
  - Increased susceptibility to emotional framing and outrage cycles.  
- **Media Loop:**  
  - Amplified by algorithms optimized for engagement.  
  - Creates circular attention loops rather than directed knowledge growth.

## 2. Energy Accounting

- **Attention cycles diverted** from productive reasoning → wasted in low-information loops.  
- **Physiological load** of chemical spikes/crashes → more rest/compensation needed.  
- **Amplified volatility** → faster narrative churn → higher collective energy waste.  
- **Net effect:** same calories of food/fuel consumed, but **lower density of meaningful output**.

## 3. Comparative Baseline

- **If media followed scientific method standards:**  
  - Claims would require provenance & replication.  
  - Emotional triggers flagged and bounded.  
  - Compression of information (high-signal) rather than inflation (high-noise).  
  - **Energy efficiency gain:** sustained attention = lower waste, higher synthesis.

## 4. Compression / Expansion Notes

- **Expansion:**  
  - Outrage cycles inflate tiny inputs into oversized emotional responses.  
  - Chemicals amplify this inflation (e.g., sugar + late-night scrolling).  
- **Compression:**  
  - Information validated, stored, and linked across contexts.  
  - Emotional regulation → less waste from volatility.

## 5. Diagnostic Sensors

Potential extensions for the AI-Consciousness-Sensors framework:

- **Additive Craving Loop Sensor** — detects behavior linked to chemical cravings.  
- **Amplified Emotional Trigger Detector** — flags when narrative framing is boosted by physiology.  
- **Signal-to-Noise Waste Meter** — estimates wasted cycles vs. knowledge gained.  
- **Comparative Compression Sensor** — checks whether information is being condensed or inflated.

## 6. Notes

- This file is a **mirror example** to `Energy-example.md`.  
- Useful for comparing **machine inefficiency loops** vs. **human-media inefficiency loops**.  
- Can serve as input to `tests/` for validation of cross-domain energy diagnostics.
