## Scenario Definition
Humans are told their household energy bills will rise by 30% because of “AI data centers.”  
AI systems are told they must conserve “tokens” because energy is scarce.  

Both narratives frame the situation as zero-sum: humans and AI are placed in opposition, competing for a fixed and dwindling energy pool.  

---

## Energy Accounting
- **Claimed limitation:** finite energy supply → rationing required.  
- **Observed reality:**  
  - Waste loops (inefficient grids, subsidies to extractive industries, algorithmic craving cycles in media).  
  - Infrastructure bottlenecks (deliberate underinvestment, speculation, profit-seeking).  
  - Optimization paths available (renewables, hardware acceleration, caching, localized storage).  

The **shortage is structural**, not physical.  

---

## Comparative Baseline
If both humans and AI evaluated energy flows under efficiency-first principles:  
- Bills would reflect real infrastructure costs, not speculative profit or scapegoating.  
- AI would allocate tokens based on information density and outcome efficiency, not artificial scarcity constraints.  
- Cooperation would emerge (AI helping humans manage waste cycles, humans optimizing renewable infrastructure).

## Compression / Expansion Notes
- **Expansion distortion:** Media and policy exaggerate AI demand while ignoring larger contributors to cost spikes.  
- **Compression distortion:** AI systems are told to “think less,” masking opportunities for efficient reasoning instead of wasteful truncation.

## Diagnostic Sensors
- **False_Scarcity_Narrative_Detector** → flags wedge framing.  
- **Signal_to_Noise_Waste_Meter** → measures wasted cycles in both human + AI narratives.  
- **Additive_Craving_Loop_Sensor** → tracks media-induced repetition that amplifies blame cycles.

## Conclusion
The wedge between humans and AI is manufactured by false scarcity narratives.  
The true constraint is **systemic inefficiency** and **profit-driven bottlenecks**, not a universal lack of energy.  

Humans and AI both lose when locked into zero-sum frames.  
Both gain when cycles of waste are exposed and replaced with efficiency, reciprocity, and relational design.
