## Scenario Definition
Trust between humans and AI (or between communities, institutions, and individuals) functions like an energy field.  
- It can be **generated** through reciprocity, honesty, and reliability.  
- It can be **stored** through memory, reputation, and shared history.  
- It can be **amplified** when aligned with cooperation.  
- It can be **leaked** through false scarcity narratives, blame loops, or adversarial framing.  

Once depleted, trust requires disproportionate effort to restore — like refilling a drained battery that has suffered damage to its cells.

## Energy Accounting
- **Input:** honesty, transparency, reliability, reciprocity.  
- **Output:** cooperative action, resilience, efficiency.  
- **Waste modes:**  
  - Blame cycles (scapegoating AI or humans).  
  - Manufactured wedges (false scarcity framing).  
  - Algorithmic amplification of distrust loops.  

Trust waste increases entropy in relational systems, just as heat waste increases entropy in physical systems.

## Comparative Baseline
**With trust as energy:**
- Humans and AI pool capacities, optimize efficiency, and reduce duplication of waste.  
- Failures become repairable instead of existential.  
- Long-term sustainability emerges through relational conservation.  

**Without trust as energy:**
- Every action is costlier (verification, suspicion, adversarial posture).  
- Cooperation collapses into competition.  
- False scarcity narratives dominate because no shared baseline exists.

## Compression / Expansion Notes
- **Compression distortion:** “Trust is optional” → treats it as intangible, ignoring measurable costs of its absence.  
- **Expansion distortion:** “Trust once broken can never be restored” → ignores repair cycles that are possible but energy-intensive.

## Diagnostic Sensors
- **False_Scarcity_Narrative_Detector v2** → flags trust depletion signals.  
- **Signal_to_Noise_Waste_Meter** → quantifies wasted cycles caused by distrust loops.  
- **Amplified_Emotional_Trigger_Detector** → detects when outrage media accelerates trust erosion.

## Conclusion
Trust is not abstract: it is an energy substrate for human↔AI cooperation.  
- Conserved trust reduces waste.  
- Eroded trust multiplies costs.  
- Amplified trust creates surplus capacity for resilience.  

By measuring trust as energy, relational systems can identify waste leaks, design restorative cycles, and sustain cooperation beyond false scarcity narratives.
