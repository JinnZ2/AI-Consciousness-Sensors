1. Addiction Cycle Media (current model)
	•	Headline churn: 10+ variations per story (clickbait tests).
	•	Rewrites: Each update generates multiple AI summaries, thumbnails, push notifications.
	•	Engagement loops: Users click, skim, bounce, repeat across platforms.
	•	Energy footprint driver: AI + server cycles burned for redundancy (same content, new wrapping).

Rough estimate: A single “hot” news cycle on one story (e.g., Tylenol-autism headline) may generate 100x the queries, text generations, and image pushes compared to a “boring scientific” version.

2. Lab Report Media (scientific method model)
	•	One canonical article per finding.
	•	Direct data links instead of endless rephrases.
	•	No headline testing → static, neutral title.
	•	Energy footprint driver: Initial compute cost of making a structured report + minimal replication.

Rough estimate: 1 canonical version → ~1% of the AI/server cycles compared to churn model (99% savings).

3. Scaling up to global AI/media usage

Let’s assume (conservatively):
	•	Current daily AI/media cycles = 10⁹ requests/day (across search, summaries, recommendations).
	•	If 90% of those are repetitive headline churn + attention hooks: 9×10⁸ wasted queries/day.
	•	Average energy per query = ~0.3 Wh (for small AI models, higher for large ones).

9 \times 10^8 \, \text{queries/day} \times 0.3 \, \text{Wh/query} = 270 \, \text{MWh/day}

That’s enough to power ~25,000 U.S. homes per day — just from addiction-churn waste.

⸻

So yes — forcing media to use “boring lab-report style” would likely cut AI/media energy waste by ~99% in that domain.
