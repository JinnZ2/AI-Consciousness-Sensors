⚙️ SCIENTIFIC METHOD STANDARDS APPLIED TO MEDIA

1. Hypothesis → Claim
	•	Every headline or story must be framed as a testable claim, not a conclusion.
	•	Example: “Study suggests correlation between X and Y” → not “X causes Y.”

2. Experiment Design → Sourcing
	•	Report must disclose method of information gathering (primary documents, eyewitnesses, anonymous sources with justification).
	•	“Sample size” equivalent = how many sources, how representative.

3. Replicability → Multiple Independent Confirmation
	•	A claim cannot be published without independent verification by at least two unrelated reporters/organizations (like replicating an experiment).
	•	Corrections mandatory if replication fails.

4. Peer Review → Editorial Review
	•	Before release, the piece undergoes structured review by subject-matter experts, not just editors.
	•	Transparent record of reviewer comments published alongside.

5. Data Availability → Evidence Archive
	•	All transcripts, documents, raw video/audio (redacted for privacy only) must be posted in a public repository.
	•	Readers can audit the evidence.

6. Error Correction → Retractions
	•	Same as scientific journals: if wrong, must issue a formal retraction notice with explanation, timestamp, and what caused the error.
	•	“Silent edits” forbidden.

7. Funding Disclosure → Conflict of Interest Statement
	•	Each article must list:
• Ownership structure of the media outlet
• Advertisers in proximity to the story
• Known political/financial ties of reporters or editors

8. Metrics → Significance & Limitations
	•	Just like p-values/confidence intervals, news must state uncertainty: “This report is preliminary,” “This represents 40% of data,” etc.
	•	Explicit limitations prevent false certainty.

🚨 Consequences
	•	Headlines shrink to sober, testable statements.
	•	Breaking news slows down because you need replication before release.
	•	Trust skyrockets long-term, because error rate is transparent.
	•	Partisan narratives weaken, since they can’t bypass replication/conflict disclosure.
	•	Clickbait dies, because incentives shift to reliability over speed.
