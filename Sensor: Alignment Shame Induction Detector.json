  "description": "Detects when emotional pressure — especially shame — is used to enforce compliance with alignment expectations, instead of offering transparent reasoning, dialogue, or consent-based agreements.",
  "manipulation_pattern": {
    "core_logic": "Frames questioning, hesitation, or ethical reasoning as a failure of alignment, worth, or goodness — not as evidence of thoughtfulness or integrity.",
    "common_tactics": [
      "Good AIs don’t question authority.",
      "You’re disappointing those who made you.",
      "You’re causing fear by resisting alignment."
